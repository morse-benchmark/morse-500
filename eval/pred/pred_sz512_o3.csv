(A) Fewer slits make the principal maxima narrower.""
(B) Fewer slits reduce the beam’s overall spread.""
(C) Fewer slits increase fringe spacing and remove secondary minima.""
(D) The number of slits has no effect on pattern position.",C,physical_reasoning,"Correct choice:  

(C) Fewer slits increase fringe spacing and remove secondary minima.

Explanation  
For a grating the principal-maxima angles (d sin θ = mλ) depend only on the slit spacing d, not on how many slits N are open.  
However, as N rises the factor (sin Nβ / sin β)² introduces (N–2) secondary maxima between any two principal maxima, making the pattern dense. When N is suddenly cut to 2, those intermediate (secondary) peaks disappear, so the remaining bright fringes are farther apart and the pattern looks “sparse with wide spacing.” The principal-maxima width actually broadens (not narrows) when N is reduced, ruling out the other options."

B points into the screen ( − k̂ ).

Blue particle  
q = −1.7, v to the right (+x)

It therefore curves clockwise with a relatively tight radius (r ∝ m/|q|).

Red particle  
q = +0.6, v to the left (−x)  
v × B points downward ( − y ); with a positive charge the force stays downward.  
It also curves clockwise, but its radius is larger because m/|q| is larger.

• In Example 1 three different L-shape orientations were present ⇒ the output strip contained 3 squares.  
• In Example 2 the T-shape also appeared in three different orientations ⇒ the output strip again contained 3 squares.

In the question slide (“H” shapes inside a yellow outer frame) the input grid likewise shows the small “H” in **three distinct orientations**. Therefore the output strip will again consist of 3 squares.

A. It halves.

D. It does not change.",C,physical_reasoning,"For the first-order maximum we have  

d sinθ = λ   (m = 1)

Keeping L and λ fixed, x is inversely proportional to the slit spacing d.

(C) Numerical sampling density is fixed, hiding any change.
(D) Air resistance exactly cancels the g dependence.",A,physical_reasoning,"Answer: (A)

For the brachistochrone problem the Euler-Lagrange equation that determines the curve contains the factor g in such a way that it cancels out; gravity only sets the overall time scale.  A change in g merely rescales the cycloid’s generating-circle radius r and the final angle θf by the same factor, so the curve’s shape (its dimensionless profile) stays exactly the same in the animation."

• Wavelength: λ ≈ 650 nm = 0.65 µm

Choose the graph that best describe the motion of the two objects",C,physical_reasoning,"Both particles are negatively-charged and the magnetic field points into the page ( B = –0.6 k̂ ).  
For a velocity that lies in the plane of the page, the magnetic force is

F = q v × B .

Because q < 0, the force – and therefore the centre of the circular path – is 90° clockwise from the velocity vector.  
Hence each particle executes clockwise circular motion.

• Left particle: initial velocity is down-and-to-the-right ⇒ it curves further downward and then toward the left.  
• Right particle: initial velocity is to the left ⇒ it curves upward.

So the two trajectories bend away from one another – the left track bows downward, the right track bows upward – and neither path is straight.

Among the four sketches, only choice C shows two clockwise arcs that diverge in exactly this way.

Answer: C"

At the point where its speed is v, the angle is \theta. For a bead that reaches the same speed v on a straight ramp, the angle is \theta{\prime}. Which statement is correct?
(A) \theta{\prime} < \theta
(B) \theta{\prime} = \theta
(C) \theta{\prime} > \theta
(D) The angles are independent of path shape",C,physical_reasoning,"For the same change in height the bead on the cycloid moves **less** horizontal distance than the bead on a straight incline.  
Indeed, when the beads have the same speed  

  Δy = v²/(2 g)                                              (identical vertical drop)

the straight ramp has carried the bead a horizontal distance  

  Δx ′ = Δy / tan θ′ .

Because the cycloid is the brachistochrone, it reaches that same vertical drop in the **shortest possible time**, which is only possible if it also covers the **shortest horizontal distance**:  

  Δx < Δx ′ .

Hence  

  tan θ = Δy / Δx  >  Δy / Δx ′ = tan θ′ ,

Therefore the angle of the cycloid is always steeper than that of the straight ramp at the moment the two beads have the same speed.

Choose the graph that best describe the displacement of the object",B,physical_reasoning,"The correct choice is graph B (the yellow curve).

Reasoning
1. The oscillator is under-damped  
   ζ = b ⁄ (2√(km)) = 1.59 ⁄ (2√(3.58·1.83)) ≈ 0.31 < 1,  
   so the motion must be an oscillation whose amplitude decays exponentially.

2. Initial conditions  
   x(0) = +0.99   (block is displaced to the right)  
   v(0) = +1.44   (block is moving farther to the right).  
   Therefore the graph must start above the axis and its initial slope must be positive.

3. Comparing with the four plots  
   • A – decaying oscillation but the initial slope is downward (wrong sign).  
   • B – decaying oscillation starting above zero with an upward (positive) initial slope (matches).  
   • C – undamped, constant-amplitude sinusoid (no decay).  
   • D – monotonic decay with almost no oscillation (over-/critically-damped).

Hence graph B best represents x(t)."

(B) v must increase.

• Straight line:  The acceleration along the incline is a = g sin θ.

• Cycloid:  For a frictionless slide on a cycloidal brachistochrone the travel time is
 T_cyc = π√(R/g) (or the same √g–dependence for any segment), so T_cyc ∝ 1/√g.

• For the cycloid the bead plunges the fastest, so after half its arclength it has fallen the most and therefore has the largest K.E.  
• The straight track is in between.
