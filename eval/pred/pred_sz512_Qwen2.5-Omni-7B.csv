14,mathematical_reasoning_algebraic_reasoning_Vector_Calculus_curl_0.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,What is the z-component of curl at the green point? Output only the letter of the correct answer,D,mathematical_reasoning,"To find the curl of the vector field F(x, y) = (-1.4y + 1.1xy)i + (1.4x - 1.1x^2)j, we use the curl formula for two-dimensional vector fields:

curl(F) = ∇ x F = ∂/dy(F_x) - ∂/dx(F_y)

For the given vector field at the green point:

F(x, y) = (-1.4y + 1.1xy)i + (1.4x - 1.1x^2)j

Let's compute the partial derivatives:

∂/dy(F_x) = ∂/dy(-1.4y + 1.1xy) = -1.4 + 1.1x
∂/dx(F_y) = ∂/dx(1.4x - 1.1x^2) = 1.4 - 2.2x

curl(F) = (-1.4 + 1.1x) - (1.4 - 2.2x)
        = -1.4 + 1.1x - 1.4 + 2.2x
        = (1.1x + 2.2x) - (1.4 + 1.4)
        = 3.3x - 2.8

(z-component) = 3.3(0) - 2.8

59,mathematical_reasoning_algebraic_reasoning_Vector_Calculus_curl_1.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,What is the z-component of curl at the green point? Output only the letter of the correct answer,C,mathematical_reasoning,"The z-component of curl at the green point can be broken down as follows:

- The y-component of curl (in i direction) is:
 \[ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (-1.4xy) - \frac{\partial}{\partial y} (0.8x - 1.4x^2) \]

- The x-component of curl (in j direction) is:
  \( \frac{\partial}{\partial y} (-0.8y + 1.4xy) - \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (0.8x - 1.4x^2) \)

Expanding these expressions:

- \( y \) component in i direction:
  \[ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (-1.4xy) = -1.4y \]
  \[ \frac{\partial}{\partial y} (0.8x - 1.4x^2) = 0 \]
  \[ -1.4y \]

- \( x \) component in j direction:
  \[ \frac{\partial}{\partial y} (-0.8y + 1.4xy) = -0.8 + 1.4x \]
  \[ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (0.8x - 1.4x^2) = 0.8 - 2.8x \]
  \[ 0.8 + 2.8x \]

Now we can compute the z-component with these:

- z-component at (2,0,1) (considering the values given by vector projection):
  \[ viz = \frac{1.4 \times 2}{\sqrt{2^2} \times 1} \]
  \[ viz = \frac{2.8}{1} = 2.8 \]

- Answering \( a = 2.8 \) seems accurate, so it's: 
  \[ \text{Correct Answer: 2.8} \]

- Finding the pre-factor that makes it match the closest possible answer, let's say:
  \[ a = 3.12 \]

- Black
- Blue
- Green
- Orange
- Pink
- Light Gray
- Dark Red
- White
- Light Blue

Observe the following inputs/outputs:

1. [A grid of blue and black squares] → [A grid of blue and white squares with one blue square missing from the top right corner]
2. [A blue background with a number ""3"" in the middle] → [A black background with a question mark inside a blue square]
3. [A blue background with a number ""10"" in the middle] → [A question mark inside a blue square]

For each of the inputs, the output is determined by eliminating the number of squares that are the same color as the number in the middle of the grid. For example:

- In the first input, there are three blue squares, so one blue square is removed, leaving two blue squares and one white square.
- In the second input, there are three blue squares, so the number ""3"" is removed, leaving a black background with a question mark inside a blue square.
- In the third input, there are ten blue squares, so the number ""10"" is removed, and the remaining squares will have a question mark inside a blue square.

Answer:

Which statement best describes the behaviour of
T_{\text{Diff}} = T_{\text{Line}} - T_{\text{Cyc}}?
(A) T_{\text{Diff}} becomes larger because the straight path shortens more slowly.
(B) T_{\text{Diff}} approaches zero because both paths become nearly horizontal.
(C) T_{\text{Diff}} becomes negative; the straight path wins for small drops.
(D) T_{\text{Diff}} oscillates unpredictably with small position changes.",C,physical_reasoning,"To analyze the behavior of \( T_{\text{DIFF}} = T_{\text{LINE}} - T_{\text{CYC}} \), we will break down each statement and evaluate its validity because we are looking at multiple-choice responses.

1. **Statement A** claims that \( T_{\text{DIFF}} \) becomes larger because the straight path shortens more slowly. This implies that \( T_{\text{LINE}} \) increases at a slower rate compared to \( T_{\text{CYC}} \) when point B moves closer to point A. To be more exact, the loss in \( T_{\text{LINE}} \) during this time might be less than the gain in \( T_{\text{CYC}} \) leading to a higher \( T_{\text{DIFF}} \).

2. **Statement B** states that \( T_{\text{DIFF}} \) approaches zero because both paths become nearly horizontal. As B moves closer to A, both the line and cycle paths approach horizontal, both paths would experience a similar change in time as gravity mainly affected the horizontal component; thus, their difference diminishes. This rendering is plausible.

3. **Statement C** mentions that \( T_{\text{DIFF}} \) becomes negative; the straight path wins for small drops. As B gets close to A, we imagine the increase of \( T_{\text{CYC}} \) becomes equivalent to that of \( T_{\text{LINE}} \), leading to \( T_{\text{DIFF}} \) to become negative indicating \( T_{\text{LINE}} \) being lesser than \( T_{\text{CYC}} \) at smaller-scale drops. At first closer positions, even a small gradient slightly favors \( T_{\text{CYC}} \), hence making \( T_{\text{DIFF}} < 0 \).

4. **Statement D** says \( T_{\text{DIFF}} \) oscillates unpredictably with small position changes. This means the difference between the times increases and decreases irregularly with minute locations of B. Though possible in more fluctuating situations, as vertical drop sets near, the path closely mimics a horizontal line.

After analyzing each statement comprehensively, the best statement describing the behavior of \( T_{\text{DIFF}} \) is **Statement B** that \( T_{\text{DIFF}} \) approaches zero as both paths become nearly horizontal since \( T_{\text{LINE}} \) and \( T_{\text{CYC}} \) are almost identical during this scenario."

Output the answer rounded to 2 decimal places.,1.9,mathematical_reasoning,"To find the definite integral using the Left Riemann Sum between two endpoints, you need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the endpoints of the interval you are integrating over. These endpoints define the limits of integration.
2. Choose a partition of the interval into subintervals. The size of each subinterval is determined by the spacing between the points where the function values are evaluated.
3. Evaluate the function at the left endpoint of each subinterval.
4. Multiply each function value by the width of its corresponding subinterval.
5. Sum up these products to get the left Riemann Sum.

If you can provide the specific endpoints and function values you are working with, I can help you calculate the left Riemann Sum."

(D) It is still at rest.",D,physical_reasoning,"### Video Transcript:
1. Incident wave reaches charges.
2. Charges oscillate and emit secondary waves.
3. Interference leads to phase delay (Δ).


### Exercise Prompt:
When the first blue incident wavefront reaches the left boundary of the grey medium layer, what is the leftmost red charge point doing?
(A) It has already started oscillating.
(B) It is momentarily stopped just before oscillation.
(C) It is oscillating at maximum phase.
(D) It is still at rest.

### Analysis:
The first step in Feynman's Refraction Model is when the incident wave reaches the charges. As the wave reaches these charges, they begin to oscillate and emit secondary waves. Considering the sequence from the video frames and the visualizations provided, the charges should have already started oscillating by the time the first blue wavefront reaches the left boundary of the grey medium layer.

### Answer:
The correct answer is:
(A) It has already started oscillating."

(rounded to 2 decimal places, start at the red dot)",-2.35,mathematical_reasoning,"I'm unable to play videos or visualize the diagram you're referring to. However, I can explain the concept of Newton's method for approximating the roots of a polynomial.

Newton's method is an iterative algorithm for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. The method starts with an initial guess and refines it to improve the approximation. The formula for Newton's method is:

\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \]

For the given problems, you would:
1. Identify the function \( f(x) \).
2. Compute the derivative \( f'(x) \).
3. Apply Newton's method formula starting from the initial guess \( x_0 \).
4. Iterate twice as specified.

The factor \( \frac{1}{8} \) in the first problem is probably related to the step size or scaling of the initial guess or function evaluation. The second problem involves a degree 22 polynomial.

For the degree 4 polynomial problem, you would set up and solve the iterations similarly. If you provide more details or equations, I can guide you through the calculation steps and help you determine how many steps are needed to reach a certain level of accuracy."

Choose the graph that best describe the displacement of the object",D,physical_reasoning,"The graph that best represents the position \( x(t) \) of a damped harmonic oscillator is the one that shows the oscillations gradually diminishing over time. This is because the damping effect reduces the amplitude of the oscillations with each cycle, leading to a decaying oscillatory motion.

Looking at the provided options:

- Graphs A and B show oder oscillations without any decay, indicating undamped harmonic oscillation.
- Graphs D and C show oscillations that decay over time, which is consistent with a damped harmonic oscillator.

However, Graph C shows a more rapid decay and spends a larger proportion of its time close to the equilibrium position compared to Graph D, which has a slower decay and oscillates around a position closer to the equilibrium position for a longer time.

",D,physical_reasoning,"The horizontal offset of \(0.345\) meters corresponds to the distance between first-order spots, which is \(2d \sin \theta\). For the first-order maxima (\(\theta = 30^\circ\)), the spacing is given by \(d/\lambda = 4.0\), where \(d\) is the slit separation and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength. The horizontal offset can be used to find the wavelength \(\lambda\).

The wavelength \(\lambda\) can be calculated using the formula for the horizontal offset of the first-order spot. For simplicity, assuming \(d = 1/600\) (since the grating has 600 lines per millimeter, implying lines are spaced \(1\) millimeter apart on average), we find \(\lambda\) while considering the sine of the angle is approximately \(\frac{1}{2}\) for \(\theta = 30^\circ\). Thus, the calculation to find \(\lambda\) is:

\[ 0.345 = \frac{2 \times \frac{1}{600}}{\lambda} \]

\[ \lambda \approx \frac{2}{0.345 \times 600} \]

\[ \lambda \approx 0.989 \text{ mm} \]

\[ \lambda \approx 989 \text{ nm} \]

Since this doesn't precisely match any of the given options, note that the closest reasonable estimate (\(d/\lambda\) spacing and typical measurements) suggests the closest match to this calculation for the second-largest angular spacing that fits \(\lambda \approx 510 \text{ nm}\).

Suppose the same 600 line/mm grating is illuminated with a red laser (λ ≈ 650 nm) at an incident angle of 30° relative to the grating normal. Approximately what will the first-order diffraction angle θ₁ (measured from the normal) be?
A. ≈ 10°
B. ≈ 20°
C. ≈ 30°
D. ≈ 40°",D,physical_reasoning,"Given:
- Incidence angle \( \alpha = 30^\circ \)
- Wavelength \( \lambda = 650 \text{ nm} \)
- Grating equation: \( d(\sin \theta_m + \sin \alpha) = n\lambda \)

For first-order diffraction (\( n = 1 \)):
\[ d(\sin \theta_1 + \sin 30^\circ) = 1 \times 650 \text{ nm} \]

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\text{To solve:} \quad \theta_1 \approx \text{?} \\
&\text{Given angles:} \quad 0.20, 0.45, 0.50 \quad \text{(mm)}.
\end{aligned}
\]

From \( \theta_1 \approx 25.2^\circ \) (directional data).

### Detailed Calculation:
\[ d + \sin 30^\circ = \frac{650 \text{ nm}}{\sin \theta_1} \]
Solving for \(\theta_1\) requires \( \sin 30^\circ = 0.5 \).

\[
d \approx 650 \text{ nm} \cdot (\sin 25.2^\circ + 0.5)
\]:
\(\sin 25.2^\circ \approx 0.4244\)

\[
\begin{aligned}
d &\approx 650 \text{ nm} \cdot (0.4244 + 0.5) \\
d &\approx 650 \text{ nm} \cdot 0.9244 \\
d &\approx 601.46 \text{ nm}.

Someone plucks the string at x = 6.2 m. How high does the fly have to jump to avoid getting hit by the wave? Output just the correct letter:,D,mathematical_reasoning,"The correct answer is B.

The fly is sitting at x = 3.7 m, and the wave is propagating at a speed of \( c = \sqrt{5} \, \text{m/s} \). To determine how high the fly has to jump to avoid getting hit by the wave, we need to calculate the time it takes for the wave to reach the fly from its starting point at x = 6.2 m.

The distance between the pluck and the fly is:
\[ \Delta x = 6.2 \, \text{m} - 3.7 \, \text{m} = 2.5 \, \text{m} \]

The time it takes for the wave to travel this distance is:
\[ t = \frac{\Delta x}{c} = \frac{2.5 \, \text{m}}{\sqrt{5} \, \text{m/s}} \]

Using the quadratic formula again, we get:
\[ t = 0.82 \, \text{s} \]

So, the fly needs to jump approximately 0.82 m to avoid getting hit by the wave."

292,mathematical_reasoning_algebraic_reasoning_Newton_Method_newtons_method_degree_4_2.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,"What is the approximation after 4 steps of Newton's method of this degree 4 polynomial? (rounded to 2 decimal places, start at the red dot)",2.32,mathematical_reasoning,"To find the approximation after 4 steps of Newton's method for the given polynomial, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the polynomial and the initial guess \(x_0\).
2. Implement Newton's method formula: 
   \[
   x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
   \]
   where \(f(x)\) is the polynomial and \(f'(x)\) is its derivative.

Let's assume the polynomial is given as \(f(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 - 2x + 2\). The initial guess is \(x_0 = 2.0\).

First iteration:
\[
x_1 = x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}
\]

Calculate \(f(x_0)\) and \(f'(x_0)\):
\[
f(2) = 2^4 + 2 \cdot 2^3 - 2 \cdot 2 + 2 = 16 + 16 - 4 + 2 = 28
\]
\[
f'(x) = 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 2 \Rightarrow f'(2) = 4 \cdot 2^3 + 6 \cdot 2^2 - 2 = 32 + 24 - 2 = 54
\]

\[
x_1 = 2.0 - \frac{28}{54} = 2.0 - 0.5185 = 1.4815
\]

Second iteration:
\[
x_2 = x_1 - \frac{f(x_1)}{f'(x_1)}
\]

Calculate \(f(x_1)\) and \(f'(x_1)\):
\[
f(1.4815) \approx 0.783 \qquad f'(1.4815) \approx 52.75
\]

\[
x_2 = 1.4815 - \frac{0.783}{52.75} \approx 1.4815 - 0.0149 \approx 1.4666
\]

Third iteration:
\[
x_3 = x_2 - \frac{f(x_2)}{f'(x_2)}
\]

Calculate \(f(x_2)\) and \(f'(x_2)\):
\[
f(1.4666) \approx 0.061 \qquad f'(1.4666) \approx 52.53
\]

\[
x_3 = 1.4666 - \frac{0.061}{52.53} \approx 1.4666 - 0.0012 \approx 1.4654
\]

Fourth iteration:
\[
x_4 = x_3 - \frac{f(x_3)}{f'(x_3)}
\]

Calculate \(f(x_3)\) and \(f'(x_3)\):
\[
f(1.4654) \approx 0.0007 \qquad f'(1.4654) \approx 52.45
\]

\[
x_4 = 1.4654 - \frac{0.0007}{52.45} \approx 1.4654 - 0.000014 \approx 1.4654
\]

Thus, the final approximation \(x_4\) is approximately **1.4654** when rounded to two decimal places."

(B) Parabola
(C) Cycloid
(D) All the same",A,physical_reasoning,"The given simulation octet displays three distinct paths: a straight line, a parabola, and a cycloid. Each path varies in its parametric equation. The equation for a straight line may present as y = mx + c, where 'm' signifies the slope and 'c' is the y-intercept. This type of path possesses uniform kinetic energy (KE).

Contrary, the parabola’s equation can be represented as y = ax^2 + bx + c. This path also exhibits uniform KE, however, it features a varying potential energy (PE) curve along the path due to its changing distance from the origin. As we move along a parabolic path, the potential energy initially decreases as we move away from the origin, reaching a minimum value at the focal point before increasing again, which results in a lower overall PE compared to the straight line for the same arc length.

A cycloid, on the other hand, is created by a point on the circumference of a circle rolling along a straight line. The cycloid’s equation is complex [x = (φ - sin φ) and y = 1 - cos φ].

So, when the particle moves along the same arc length s = 1.0 on each track, the path that shows the largest magnitude of PE is the Straight Path."

Choose the graph that best describe the displacement of the object",B,physical_reasoning,"The problem involves understanding the behavior of a damped harmonic oscillator given specific parameters: mass \( m = 1.83 \), spring constant \( k = 3.58 \), damping coefficient \( b = 1.59 \), initial position \( x(0) = 0.99 \), and initial velocity \( v(0) = 1.44 \).

The solution builds on the final velocity of an initially nonzero velocity particle under constant acceleration, which accelerates at 4 meters per second squared.

The equations derived in the video show that:
- If \( a = 0 \), \( x_0 = 0 \)
- The kinematic equation \( x = 0.3 \) is solved for \( a \) which requires the assumption \( x_0 = 0 \)

Given the problem's parameters and the initial condition \( x(0) \neq 0 \), a different approach is necessary to find the correct displacement curve.

After a detailed analysis, the correct displacement applies a constant acceleration \( a = -0.016 \) or \( a = -0.058 \):
\[ \left[\begin{array}{l}a_{-1}=a \\ a_{1}=a-a \\ a_{2}=a-a \\\end{array}\right] \]

This calculation results: \( -0.070 = =0.15 \)

(rounded to 2 decimal places, start at the red dot)",-0.59,mathematical_reasoning,"To solve the problem using Newton's method, we need to follow these steps:

1. Define the polynomial function \( f(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 - 12x^2 - 14x + 29 \).
2. Compute the derivative of the function \( f(x) \), denoted as \( f'(x) \).
3. Choose an initial approximation \( x_0 \) at the red dot (x=0). Newton's method is used iteratively to refine this approximation.
4. Use the following iteration formula to generate the next estimate:
\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \]

Let's perform the calculations for the first four iterations:

Iterative steps:

1. Evaluate \( f(0) = 29 \) and \( f'(0) = -14 \).
2. \( x_1 = 0 - \frac{29}{-14} = \frac{29}{14} \approx -0.00 \).

So, as c/n increases, we can see that the kg in some of these triangles actually decrease. So, as c/n increases, the angle increase. We see that the side lengths show that as these angles are getting smaller, the numerator is actually getting smaller, while the denominator is getting bigger. The side length which it is opposite to v decreases as well, meaning that v must decrease as well, because as the angle approaches zero, the variable v is also approaching zero.So, the correct answer is C. v must decrease."

What is the approximate phase delay \Delta\phi (in radians)? (Use 2\pi \approx 6.28.)
(A) 2.90 \times 10^{4}
(B) 1.45 \times 10^{4}
(C) 4.83 \times 10^{3}
(D) 9.66 \times 10^{2}",C,physical_reasoning,"To calculate the phase delay $\Delta \phi$ experienced by the red light as it passes through the glass plate, we can use the following formula:

$$\Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \cdot d \cdot n$$

where:

- $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light in vacuum,
- $d$ is the thickness of the glass plate,
- $n$ is the refractive index of the glass plate.

First, we need to convert the thickness of the glass plate from nanometers to meters:

$$d = 2.0 \text{ nm} = 2.0 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$$

Now, we can plug the values into the formula:

$$\Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi}{650 \times 10^{-9}} \cdot 2.0 \times 10^{-9} \cdot 1.50$$

Calculating the values:

$$\Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi}{650} \cdot (2.0 \times 10^{-7}) \cdot 1.50$$

$$\Delta \phi = 0.0927 \cdot (2.0 \times 10^{-7}) \cdot 1.50$$

$$\Delta \phi = 0.00280 \text{ (radians)}$$

Now, we can convert the phase delay from radians to turns using the provided conversion:

$$\Delta \phi = 0.00280 \cdot \frac{1}{2\pi} \text{ turns}$$

$$\Delta \phi = 0.00280 \cdot 0.159\text{ (turns)}$$

$$\Delta \phi = 0.000444\text{ (turns)}$$

Rounding to one decimal place, the phase delay is approximately $0.45$ turns. This corresponds to option (B)."

(A move is defined as going one step in any valid direction: up, down, left, or right, without crossing walls.)
Please return a single number (e.g. 3). Nothing preceding or following it.",69,planning_reasoning,"To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of moves required to visit all letters exactly once starting from the green square (A) in the given maze, we need to use a systematic approach. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Identify the Start Point**: The start point is the green square (A).

2. **Plot the Maze**: Visually plot the maze, marking the start point and all other points of interest (B, C, D).

3. **Determine the Path**: The goal is to find a path that visits each letter exactly once. We need to consider all possible paths and calculate the minimum number of moves required for each.

4. **Calculate Moves**: Each move is defined as going one step in any valid direction: up, down, left, or right, without crossing walls. We need to keep track of the number of moves taken to visit each letter.

To find the minimum number of moves required to visit all letters exactly once, we need to use an algorithmic approach, such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP) algorithm, which is a classic problem in computer science and discrete mathematics. However, for this specific maze, we can also use a more intuitive approach by manually identifying the path with the least number of moves.

For this given maze, a possible optimal path could be:
1. Move from A to B
2. Move from B to C
3. Move from C to D
4. Move from D to E

In this path, we make 3 moves in total: 1 move from A to B, 1 move from B to C, and 1 move from C to D, and then 1 move from D to E.

Therefore, the minimum number of moves required to visit all letters exactly once, starting from the green square (A), is 3.

(rounded to 2 decimal places, start at the red dot)",-1.92,mathematical_reasoning,"To find the approximation after 2 steps of Newton's method, we need to follow the algorithm for two iterations. The general form of Newton's method for approximating a root of a function \( f \) is given by:

\[
x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
\]

Given the initial point \( x_0 = -3.0 \) and the equation \( y = x^5 - 4x + 3 \), we first need the function \( f(x) \) and its derivative \( f'(x) \):

\[
f(x) = x^5 - 4x + 3
\]
\[
f'(x) = 5x^4 - 4
\]

### Step 1: First iteration
Calculate \( f(x_0) \) and \( f'(x_0) \):

\[
f(-3) = (-3)^5 - 4(-3) + 3 = -243 + 12 + 3 = -228
\]
\[
f'(-3) = 5(-3)^4 - 4 = 5(81) - 4 = 405 - 4 = 401
\]

Now apply the Newton's method formula:

\[
x_1 = x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} = -3 - \frac{-228}{401} \approx -3 + 0.569 = -2.431
\]

### Step 2: Second iteration
Calculate \( f(x_1) \) and \( f'(x_1) \) at the new point \( x_1 = -2.431 \):

\[
f(-2.431) \approx (-2.431)^5 - 4(-2.431) + 3 \approx -74.997 - (-9.724) + 3 \approx -62.273
\]
\[
f'(-2.431) \approx 5(-2.431)^4 - 4 \approx 5(34.027) - 4 \approx 166.135 - 4 = 162.135
\]

Now apply the Newton's method formula again:

\[
x_2 = x_1 - \frac{f(x_1)}{f'(x_1)} \approx -2.431 - \frac{-62.273}{162.135} \approx -2.431 + 0.384 \approx -2.047
\]

So, the approximation after 2 steps of Newton's method is approximately **-2.047**."

Which color shape took the longest amount of time to reach from the previous shape? Answer with only the color name.,orange,spatial_reasoning,"In this video, the instructions and questions guide the viewer through a visual exercise focused on color recognition and observation. The exercise begins with a title card asking the viewer to ""Remember the following color names."" Accompanying this text are six colored squares, each paired with a color name: blue, red, orange, green, yellow, purple, and white. This part of the video serves as an introduction to the task, ensuring that the viewer is familiar with the color names.

Following the initial introduction, the title card disappears, and the question changes to a new prompt: ""Observe the trajectory of the arrow."" This shift in instructions introduces a new dynamic where the viewer must track the movement of a central white arrow on the screen. The arrow is set against a simple, light gradient gray background with a darker gray triangle on the left, providing a clear and uncluttered visual context.

As the video progresses, the arrow starts moving in a wavy pattern from the left side of the screen, passing through variously colored shapes. The shapes include a red triangle, a blue square, an orange square, and a purple triangle. Each shape is distinct and occupies a different position on the screen, allowing for easy distinction and tracking. The movement of the arrow forms a zigzag path, encouraging the viewer to follow its route carefully.

Throughout the video, the key objectives remain clear: to remember the color names of the given squares and to observe the trajectory of the moving arrow. This dual focus helps to engage the viewer in active observation and reinforces the color recognition skills being tested.

The video effectively combines simple, clean visuals with clear, concise instructions to create an engaging and educational experience. By providing a straightforward task of color recognition and trajectory observation, it tests the viewer's ability to process and remember visual information, making it a useful tool for improving cognitive skills."

(B) TLine quadruples, TCyc doubles.

(A) It moves closer to the center.""
(B) It moves farther from the center."",
(C) It stays in the same place.""
(D) Only its brightness changes; the position stays the same.""",A,physical_reasoning,"To answer the question regarding the position of the first-order fringe when the line spacing \( d \) (i.e., the slit spacing) is increased, let's consider the principles of the double-slit experiment and diffraction patterns.

In the double-slit experiment, when coherent light passes through two closely spaced slits, it produces an interference pattern on a screen behind the slits. For the first-order fringe (the first bright spot outside the central maximum), the condition for constructive interference is given by:

\[ d \sin \theta = m \lambda \]

where:
- \( d \) is the distance between the slits,
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light,
- \( \theta \) is the angular position of the fringe from the central maximum,
- \( m \) is the order of the fringe (1 for the first-order fringe).

As we increase the line spacing \( d \), the distance between the slits increases. This means that the distance \( d \sin \theta \) at which constructive interference occurs increases. Because sine is a linearly increasing function around zero degrees, increasing \( d \) results in increasing \( \theta \).

Therefore, the lies in the first-order fringe move farther from the center of the screen.

The correct answer is:
(B) It moves farther from the center."

427,spatial_reasoning_rotation_and_transformation_cubes_count_3.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,Observe the following structure. How many cubes are left? Answer with a single integer. ,72,spatial_reasoning,"In the video, a 3x3x3 cube structure is shown. When individual cubes are removed from the corners, each removal affects the total count of cubes. The video highlights that there are 27 cubes initially, and if you take away 4 cubes (one from each corner), the total remains the same because corner cubes are part of the larger structure's outer layer, not counted again once removed.

Why the answer is 27:

1. **Initial Cube Count**: We start with a 3x3x3 cube structure, consisting of:
   - 3 cubes per layer in each dimension (x, y, z).
   - Total cubes = 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 cubes.

2. **Corner Cube Removal Issue**: The video demonstrates clearly that removing a corner cube and replacing it with another cube (e.g., transforming it into a cross-like structure) does not change the count. By moving cubes from the outer layer to the inner layer, you are simply redistributing the cubes without reducing the total count.

Therefore, whether you look at the layers or individual cubes,
- **Layer Count Approach** - You still have three layers with 9 cubes each, which total 27.
- **Individual Cube Count Approach** - After removing the outer layer cubes, they are rearranged but still counted individually, leading to a total of 27 cubes.

Thus, the answer to ""How many cubes are left?"" is **27**. The total count remains unchanged despite the removal and movement of cubes within the structure."

(C) Cycloid
(D) All the same",A,physical_reasoning,"To determine the track with the smallest kinetic energy (KE) at the midpoint of each track, we need to analyze the energy conservation simulation graph.

1. **Straight Line Track**:
   - The straight line track (Path: Straight) has the steepest slope, indicating a high kinetic energy as the object accelerates linearly with increasing potential energy.

2. **Parabola Track**:
   - The parabola track (Path: Parabola) is less steep compared to the straight line, indicating a more gradual increase in kinetic energy.

3. **Cycloid Track**:
   - The cycloid track (Path: Cycloid) is the smoothest, with a gentle curve, indicating a slower increase in kinetic energy.

At the midpoint of each track (arc length = L/2):
- The straight line track will have the highest kinetic energy due to its steep slope.
- The cycloid track will have the least kinetic energy due to its smooth, gradual curve.
- The parabola track will have a higher kinetic energy than the cycloid track but lower than the straight line track.

Therefore, the track with the smallest KE at the midpoint of each track is:

There are 5 currencies and 7 coins visible in the image. The task asks how many dominoes fell before the fourth green domino. We know that the bottom row of each domino represents the left side of the Celsius temperature scale, and the top row represents the right side. Starting from the left, we can count the dominoes as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. When we reach the fourth green domino, we can see that the third domino (from the left) on the bottom row is green. Therefore, we can conclude that 3 dominoes fell before the fourth green domino."

A yellow mug and a blue wooden block are placed on a rotating turntable that rotates clockwise illuminated by a spotlight casting their shadow on the wall behind it. Static shot with no camera movement.

Select one letter (e.g., N). If none of them are realistic, return None.",B,physical_reasoning,"The video shows six different configurations of a yellow mug and a blue wooden block on a rotating turntable, illuminated by a spotlight against a wall. The question asks which of these earlier demonstrations maintains physical coherence effectively.

To determine the correct answer, we need to evaluate the physical coherence among all frames. Physical coherence refers to whether the relationship between objects remains consistent throughout the video.

Let’s analyze each frame considering its ability to maintain this physical coherence:

- In frame **A:** The yellow mug and blue wooden block are both visible and stationary, indicating no德拉ation.
- In frame **B:** The yellow mug and blue wooden block retain their positions, showing continuity.
- In frame **C:** Again, no change; the objects maintain the same position, ensuring coherence.
- In frame **D:** The objects shift abruptly, disrupting the consistent position observed in previous frames.
- In frame **E:** Despite some change, objects maintain relative positions with no major disruption.
- In frame **F:** The objects maintain their positions, ensuring continued coherence.

Given the information that none of the captions are realistic (i.e., time jumps, drastic changes, etc.) However, it aligns with maintaining the visual sequence:

Based on that,
