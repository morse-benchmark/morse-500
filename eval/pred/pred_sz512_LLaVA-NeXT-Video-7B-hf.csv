",A,temporal_reasoning," The robot in the image is performing a task of sorting or placing bowls on the right side of a tray, and it makes a stoppage to empty the contents of a bowl into another bowl. The symbol representing the letter ""D"" next to the robot indicates the second segment of a sequence where there has been a change or pause in the operation. The ""@"""" next to the letter ""D"" suggests an index, potentially for humans to understand and annotate the stop points or specific actions. After ""D"", the robot returns to rest and moves the bowls again. The sequence can be understood to represent an automated servicing process, where a workplace sees the robot's active tasks stopped and then resuming its tasks."

D. 4
E. 5",C,spatial_reasoning," To find the value of the given expression which represents a geometric pattern, you need to follow the simple procedures. First, identify the value of the common traverse and then the value of the non-traverse duplication. The common traverse folds only 1 and arrives at the top 2 and bottom 2 via the first and second traverse respectively. Subtract 1 to the value of the first traverse then add 1 to the top 1 and subtract 1 more to itself, now we're up at the top 1, 1, and 2. Then, do a similar proceeding from the second traverse to reach this point. You don't cross over a point again, only fold up from bottom to the top. 1 on second traverse. Now, calculate the sum of three non-traverse, which is 3, and subtract that from the value of first non-traverse, which will yield 2 when subtracting 1 from the non-traverse. Finally, you're up at the top 1. Then you subtract 2 from a non-traverse on the second fold which gives the 1 that reaches the top 2. Simply follow these steps to determine the value of this expression, which is related to a geometric pattern."
6,abstract_reasoning_logical_reasoning_arcagi2_combined_7b0280bc_count.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,How many light gray squares should appear in the output grid? Answer with a single integer,38,abstract_reasoning," To answer the given question, we will first plot the given points on a two-dimensional coordinate system as a scatter plot. This will help visualize the distribution of the points and determine if any significant pattern emerges. If any significant (>3) membership function overlap is observed, it implies we have identified a group of points that should be closer or farther apart, which is the case for 4D membership function with finite boundaries and non-clipped minmal distance calculations by Lévy (Fn) = [0.5,0.34,0.6,0.3].


The plot seems to show two distinct groups of points clustered together on one side of the first function apart from the vertical line. The plot for the two-player game rule does not have any significant membership function overlap and instead follows a different path, indicating the groups are farther apart, which is as per Lévy's rule for non-clipped minimum distance.


To simplify further, one possible explanation is that the clusters represent different regions or groups in our brains, areas responsible for balance-related abilities or information experiences - one for aesthetics or artistic intent, one for compass orientation, and other for consultation or interest, while the one-dimensional overlapping shows adjustments based on intentions and context. The games may represent situations that require these abilities cooperatively."

14,mathematical_reasoning_algebraic_reasoning_Vector_Calculus_curl_0.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,What is the z-component of curl at the green point? Output only the letter of the correct answer,D,mathematical_reasoning," To solve the curved surface area of a chord given the central angle and the length of the chord, follow these steps:



1. Convert the arc length to circumference units (c) by dividing the arc length by 2π. The arc length is \((2πr) \times θ) where r is the radius of the circle and θ is the central angle in degrees.
2. Multiply the arc length by π and add π to the length of the chord to find the total length of the circular arc. Let this be (\(πr \times θ - r).
3. Calculate the revised arc length, which is the difference between the total length of the circular arc and the chord length, by adding the chord length to the revised length.
4. Use the formula \(A = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{(r^2 + h^2 - r^2})\) to find the area of the curved surface.
5. Substitute the values: \(r = \frac{c}{2πr}\) for the radius, \(θ = \frac{θ - \frac{360}{2}\pi}\) for the central angle in degrees, and \(h = \frac{c - r}{2}\times π\) for the distance from the center of the arc to the end of the chord to find the area \(A\) to answer the question.



In the example provided, we have:
\(c = 6.444\) \(r = \frac{c}{2πr} = \frac{6.44}{2 \pi}\) \(θ = \frac{360 - \frac{60}{2 \pi} \times 5\pi\) = 2π - 30 \) \(h = \frac{6.4}{2 \pi} \times \frac{6.4}{5π \) = \frac{5.58889 \times π\)


Substituting these and solving the formula, we get \(A = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{(r^2 + h^2 - r^2)\) = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{(6.4^2 - (6.4)^2) + (6.4^2) = \frac{1}{6.4} \times \frac{1.05497 \times π\) = \frac{0.381\)

The cube starts with a pattern on all sides, in one color, then a single color is removed on one side, and then another is added on the other, resulting in a pattern where no side has the color it originally had. The same pattern continues for five more steps, alternating the removal and addition of colors on each side until all the sides have only one color, which tells us that the cube was shown in its net cube form with that pattern of adding and removing sides."

19,abstract_reasoning_logical_reasoning_arcagi2_combined_409aa875_count.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,How many pink squares should appear in the output grid? Answer with a single integer,21,abstract_reasoning," In the image provided, there are two blocks of numbers that need to be paired with their respective colors. The numbers on the left are already segregated into rows and columns by color. It appears that the top right block of numbers contains both even and odd numbers:


`10009 2200 215 22`


while the bottom left contains the even numbers:


`0210 030 040`


The green numbers are the even numbers in pink's place and the blue numbers are where the odd numbers are. Now, the task is to find the two blocks:


1. That only contains even numbers or
2. That contains odd numbers and their variants.


In this case, we have:

Even numbers: `209 49`
Variants of odd numbers: `219 01`


To find the missing odd numbers that are paralleled with their alternates, you need to rotate `20` to make them even or rotate `029` to make them odd. The rotated numbers are:


For even numbers:
`020` (from bottom left) now as `2`
`200` (from top left) to become `29`
`120` (from top left) to `19`
`020` (from left) to become `9` but it will cause an error; the only two numbers incomplete are `2` and `20`.


Variants of odd numbers:
`21` (from bottom left) to `29`
`020` (from top left) now as `219`
`19` (from top left) to `7`
`020` to make it odd, but one number is missing, which is `0`
`020` from top left to `210` (which is missing)


This suggests that there is no missing number from the pink block in the video. It completes both the odd and even numbers as well as the missing numbers (`2`, `19`, `7`, and `20`), but `0` from the pink block (which should be `20` but is missing)."
20,abstract_reasoning_logical_reasoning_arcagi2_combined_269e22fb_mc.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,Which output grid should follow? Answer with one multiple choice option.,a,abstract_reasoning," Sure, I can help you with that. The image you've provided appears to be a type of optical illusion involving a figure surrounded by diagonal lines which create an ambiguous and layered perception. The top left figure is not an optical illusion because it is solid and clearly drawn; however, the bottom two figures on the right are an optical illusion created by diagonal lines.


The correct and one figure none appear to be separate and clear figures, while the top and none have diagonal lines around them.


The correct answer is that the image on the left is not an optical illusion because the figure is solid and clearly drawn, while the top and bottom right 2 figures have diagonal lines around them.


Apparently, this is a classic type of optical illusion that involves the perception of the number of figures and the lines. Here, the lines create the illusion of continuity where there should be distinct figures. This is a classic demonstration of what happens when you try to process information where there are two pattern completions different patterns that can fishtail into each other."

In terms of 2D projection, this cube is seen as two rectangles because the lines that formed the corners of the cube are parallel to a single horizontal line that cuts through the center of the cube and the edges are perpendicular to this line, creating a simple rectangle.

Your answer should only be a number (e.g. 1).",10,planning_reasoning," To determine whether the marlin-fishing method woolly-hosker loses the knot shown, you need to follow its steps. In the image, there is an embarrassment of rings floating in the air, and one ring that's not tied up yet (the leftmost ring). To complete, the marlin-fishing process, the rightmost ring would be tied to the woolly-hosker first. After that, which side of the ring the marlin will jump into and if it goes into the turned-inside, it gets turned over onto the right side, and the rightmost ring gets turned inside to the right. However, on this marlin, it jumps onto the left side and is turned inside, staying on the ring inside, so let's undo all rings from the left and begin again, except for the left one, which stays on: the woolly-hosker. Now, if it jumps on to the right or the inside ring, the marlin gets turned inside. This is a standard set of behaviors for marlin-fishing. To avoid confusion, you'll alternate the inside versus outside ring and can't turn the outside ring to the right. Then, you'll know it when you're far enough with the marlin to make right turns. In this case, whichever happens is the rightmost ring here gets #1 – if you're going in the inside, it goes inside, and if it's the outside, it turns right. It remains inside. In this case, it stays inside, so you turn inside. Remember to alternate following the flyer's direction and the marlin's side to know in which one you're currently."

The video is focused on brainstorming about Euler's Method: a simplified version of the binomial theorem which is the process of expanding powers in a series of binomial coefficients. The problem and answer provided includes the following:


given elev = 5#
solve the problem properly

elev = interaction of 10 (since only 1 in 2 squares on the board is replicated )

elev' = replicate 10

steps = the step '''÷10
a third and odd
1.4 == 1/3
a/3 = 1/1.4
 bonus = 0.6 and (elev divided by 1)
probably correct answer is
a third and odd
(length = 8)

The correct answer provided in the video shows the steps in detail to solve Euler’s Method, which one can do as follows:
select the length of the rectangle, e.g., lengths of binary digits 50 and 2, which are both 8 in this case. Subtract the binomial coefficient (in this case, 1/3) so as to get 2/3, the last digit is 0 then add the number 2/3 for length 1.4, then multiply by the replicate 3/2 to get 6 for 'probably correct' answer.

The rope itself includes three loops: a right loop, a left loop, and a double loop. This type of tie is a half hitch knot. The strings on either side of the double loop are tied tightly together, and later will serve as a hanging point for the rope. The lines strung across the rope are not separate strings but might be different sections of the rope itself, forming the structure that we call a net or a border, and the edges of this net are elastic so that they stretch and push out against rocks when pulled on one side.

The dot switches its position back and forth every other frame, B. When Green light comes in, C. When the Red light comes in, D. When Blue light comes in, E. All of the above",BCD,temporal_reasoning," To answer the question in the video, we need to look for the new information presented along with the outline that is displayed on the right side. Starting from the bottom, we have:


1. Throttles to bounce-not Cuz's blood type.
2. Light doesn't switch but suddenly slides to 0 when power applied.
3. Misses every basic part and bleep with everystage.
4. Needfully moves across

Now let's move to the question related to step 3 and step 4. The PSU switches off when we put a blue flashlight in (opposite of step all the above), and the green flash comes on. This would explain explanation 1.

For step 2, light doesn't switch but suddenly slides to 0 when power is applied. It means that either the indicator light doesn't respond or behaves abnormally. So, step 2, when the blue flashlight is out - no light.
For step 1, which is not related to any of the displayed steps, an electric fault could cause the sensors to bounce on Cuz's blood type.
For step 4, all the steps mentioned are too basic. We need to ask more questions to narrow down the solution. The very basic steps seem off.
So, what is the key detail to understand here? The steps 1, 3, and 4 are not related to A, B, or E at all and seem too basic for many reasons. We should be looking for something to connect all of the information with one another.

Let's look at the details:
- A [move to other 1 & 4].
- Instrument for B [keep at 0 power for all].
- Sort of else [o] - what means the S arrived at Execution = standard?

- While you wash [I].
- The device plants [Executive = Mazur].


Now, while you use Mazur for all the above [I & C] (and only later in the last one, we also have Mazur on Execution. This is how we move through devices].

The detailed question demands certain lights.
Green already, which is the lighter step/but the next light in series gets very bright [not blue]. We know that only the green light is bright.

Red all around, the next light is not blurry.

Seems like a problem is just in the one light [every device, only 1].
Solution involves limit test [real loc=-abs=]. Then, with instruments sorted, we shift to X1** and then back to ones below that apply [washed]. Then Mazur continues [while only then].
- Power is on all the time [I].


**Back to the question when you wash** wash [and later ""done""**].
**Sort of else** that comes near it is BEV [I = control].

- Check all (the new*) info [hence ""more""] that we have the Mazur MultiFit RF** but only [now].
Then, our situation directly gets closer by our own explanation [util] impending at the top of the instrument.


For Step 4, beam** now}**.
**Distance:**
**Power** switches thtough before we turn to red or blue.
Additional light on right [middle of tool].
For step 3, sort of else, we might add ""No power"" to WHEN it comes on and all of the above [turn to green light].

*Fine here*:


Other basic points we've made is that when this problem arises, it affects item 54***.

Now we're looking for something where none of the answers fit.

Link all this info and get a bit closer:
For step 1, none of the 6 suggestions is true, or it isn't there.

For step 2, not true either**.
For Step 4, sort of else is correct while you're correct, none of the above.
Check this out for step 3: sort of else [o]; it is Mazur multi, which we saw a bit earlier, and according to its presence, the right emission [blue or all other] may mean Mazur.
So we had Mazur all along with a standard one [turns to light-switch mode].
In case of the Mazur MultiFit RF, like so, it does make all the above states [red, blue...]
Then at step 2, if the power's solid, all of the Mazur MultiFit gets correct.
For the little reason of the green light, it's red, and at other step in the sequence, power is always on.


According to Step 1, point to bulb 5 again (our point).
Step 4, is there?
For Step 3: the answer provided is that the turn to red. However, it's also possible that electric lights have already turned to red.
For Step 4, it's step 3 [trs lights], makes all come in red after [to red].


Electric windows [el] is sort of switcher in point**, so trousers in some form of electrocentral?
**Sort out** to find a basic electric windows switch, or other similar item with single light.

Electric windows [fb].


Now, let's come to the thing that means electric. We're starting to see lights [fb] with our above list in mind**.
Basic task is to get bussed through red, in one swap.

Red and blue lights [s] [bls] (which are off/on).
Green and stage [gs of the bws][gso with gdl].
***WRONG***, swap only green light to turn red is at step somewhere.
Our best guess would be solar+****, where we would replace the R with *[L]. Is it at some stage of the bus?
Function of bus is simple+**central+** [bc of any bus is USEF].
Sort out basic light panel [ebl], maybe include the only light in the buss.
For the Bulb swivel, yes, Mazur is fine, [multif].


A hypothesis is [is it on or off].
Still have to work through the scripts, conditions, to switch [opens/close].
For Step 4, it's a tougher problem; we will do it with other lights as one above [we're looking at it still, why not find issues!].
For step 2, none of them seem to [***don't fail**].


Red and blue lights at step 2, [s of bws].
Diagnostic/**doc** is more serious**.
For step 1, sort of else [inquire about any colour].
Tracking *sort of else* really early.**The battery+sparkplug, do they acknowledge **any** state?
For other switches, we could catch the one for red to, for some reason, at Step 1. This seems to hold, though don't know about [the script].
We can sort of invent, too: exhausted+working+all switch can **end** red**as a light switch.

One more investigation is needed to a diagnostic! No answer has fulfilled any script.

For step 1, at least we have a check from Izor for raw [contacts going] to red.
For step 2, again, none of the suggestions are true [wrong].

For Step 3, we need to address the buss, sub-bus for that bls, and only green+ one light. Solves Mazur.

Now, the visual reaction is to the switch. That's to take that red up [and go].
The off elsewhere is being played by the script via green [pose red bls].

For Step 1, turn the light [go from red].
Step 1 [isn't working], which is Step 1 [to red].

The green light quietly frequently goes from [turned off to+]: flash in] no response at all.

***WRONG**, could be the response of red now. [none of the alternatives].


BUT, a flashlight *function* does turn 1. One of the scripts sets it in all parts [one light center]. And the flashlight puts it on [automatically].
For Step 2, again, none of the suggestions are true**.
For Step 4, sameissione *chand bee none of the above [no contact].

We're looking for a switch. Use the word **sub-bus** for it**.
For the model [not what you think**], [***don't use model**].
A switch to somewhere [mwb['me'] [highlight].
The green light goes from+ into sub-bus [here, bws].


Get two red lights, either go-ideal [go estimunk].
Green light, what could that mean?
It's turn to be ***bright*** [only because every other light is very dark itself]. Turning on suddenly to red.
Find a relay---[sc/fx/something].
For Step 1, the double function [model*]. Model 1 is *super light*, so where one light comes on [is our model].
Find the relay to get up, or switch, so that Model 1 might [or not] ***match**].
At other levels [bls], the green light becomes bright [model 1].

Get all seven scripts, find it [model 1**].


For Step 3, it remains a Mazur sub-instrument [gluc], and it does come on, turning power on [new diagnostic info].
For Step 2, goonBasics [analytics of a light]. The power moves in anywhere without switching [should involve loads of models**!].
Get ready for brighter green light [70%].

Somewhat goes to model, with Mazur [the command].


NO ANSWER. Brighter *green* light [~70%].
More, far less[18].

(rounded to 2 decimal places, start at the red dot)",-0.90,mathematical_reasoning," In the image provided, there are two parallel lines which are slopping upwards to the right. The concept you are asking about is related to the derivative of those lines as they approach the origin (0,0) on the horizontal axis. To calculate the slope of these lines as they approach the origin, we first recall the formula for slope of a line that represents rate of change of x with respect to y:


slope = rise/run


However, when a line is set up as x, which is the independent variable in this case — slope - the rate of change of y with respect to x — we can use a bit of trigonometry. For this situation, the angle is at 90 degrees. Note that the slope of a line with an angle of 90 degrees (using a negative slope because the line is sloping up, down or to the right) can be found using the tangent function:


tan(90) = 1


Therefore, we have:

rise/run = 1


We can manipulate this to the standard slope formula by dividing both the numerator and denominator by a(rise / run) on the right hand side:

a(rise / run) = rise / run
a = 1/rise / run
a = 1
Divide both sides by 2 to get the slope of the standard form:
a = 1/2 (since the term of rise is one over run textually)


Using this formula, the slope of the line as it approaches the origin (0,0) would be:
1/2


However, since the line was set up reversing the x-axis in this case (from right to left), the actual sign in the derivative would be negative, meaning +1 since the line is actually sloping downwards. The slope is -1/2, which means it is a negative slope. So the actual sign is a minus. This means the function that represents the slope with a negative mirror image is -1/2 when the line approaches the origin."

This image depicts a simple puzzle with several shapes. The solution would be to connect all the shapes to form a single line. This can be achieved by moving the blocks in a specific pattern to match the following their lines as closely as possible. In this case, the pattern can be found by sliding the red blocks in the wells from the inside to match the outline, cleaving the blue blocks in the exposed area from below, flipping the slanted blue blocks over and aligning stuff as it should match the undone parts, and alternating the red blocks with the top part. The completed lines leave a line pattern when compared to the pattern on the inside and then the outside. The next part to turn is the candy; only the underside of red lights are placed on this side to match the edges gaps and the bottom ones in the darker well, completed line to join the larger areas to make a neat line.

Output only the letter of the correct answer,C,mathematical_reasoning," In the image provided, the problem involves finding the remainder of the expression \(b \cdot a^0 \cdot c^3 \cdot (b^2 \cdot a^{-1})^2\).



The calculation is done by subtracting the sequence of beams's divisions and the beams' colors starting from within the bottom-right corner of the composition from right to left and moving diagonally towards the top-left corner until the result is reached. The sequence starts from \(b^2 \cdot a^{-3} \cdot b^{-1} \cdot a^{0^{-1}\) starting from the bottom-right corner. The next beam is \(b^2 \cdot a^{-1}\) from the top-right upper diagonal and moving downwards, then \(a^{-1} \cdot b^{-2} \cdot a^{0^{-1}\) starting from the right-top diagonal, then \(a^{-2} \cdot b^{-2} \cdot a^{0^{-1}\) from the upper-right diagonal, and finally \(a^{-2} \cdot a^0 \cdot b^0\) from the bottom-right diagonal.


The sequence of beams and their divisions is \(b^2 \cdot b^{-3} \cdot c^{-1} \cdot c^2 \cdot a^{-2} \cdot b^{-3} \cdot a^{2} \cdot b^{3} \cdot a^{-2} \cdot b^{-1} \cdot b^{-2} \cdot b^3\) and their corresponding colors switch from right to the left and top to bottom. At the end, the last remaining beam (bottom-right) gives the remainder as \(a^0 \cdot a^{-2} \cdot a^{-1} \cdot b^{-1} \cdot b^0 \cdot b^{-2} \cdot b^2 \cdot b^1 \cdot b^{-1} \cdot b^0\)."

Answer with a single integer.,0,spatial_reasoning," The answer involves a method of counting called the ""Place Value Theory"" which uses a base of 10 to model the counting process of 100 or 100's and 1000 or 10000, respectively. The image depicts the numbers from 1 to 100, counting ones, 10, 1000 of 10's, or 10000, and 100000 of 10's with each of those sequences starting and ending with ones. The method combines the base-10 place value system with a visual representation, allowing kids to understand the place value in a more concrete and practical way. A single ""one"" is the unit or ""base,"" and numbers representing our counting system employ the powers of the base, such as ""ten"" or ""hundred,"" ""thousand,"" ""million,"" ""ten thousand,"" and so on.

74,spatial_reasoning_rotation_and_transformation_cubes_missing_3.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,Observe the following structure. How many cubes are missing from this figure? Answer with a single integer.,72,spatial_reasoning," To find the many cubes missing from the lamp in the puzzle depicted in the image, we need a mathematical approach. Let's consider the number of cubes that should be placed in the top position, bottom position, and sides of the lampshade.


For the top position, since a side lamp cannot have multiple rows or columns of cubes and only has a single row, then from each side, there are many sides. Therefore, at the top, we get (1x3) + (3x2) + (3x2) = 6 cubes.

For the bottom position, as there are only two sides (ignoring unseen cubes on the hexagonal edge), we get two sides (ignoring rear). So, (0x2) + (2x2) = 2 cubes.

For the sides of the lampshade, we get one side from each visible edge, making it (1x1) + (1x1) + (1x1) + (1x1) + (1x1) + (1x1) + (1x1) = 13 cubes. Estimating the unseen sides from the corners, it is the same, giving a total of (1x1) + (1x1) + (1x1) + 2x1 = 5 cubes.
The total number of cubes including all edges is now (6x1) + 2 + 5 = (6x1) + 7.

Now in each space that looks visible, which is a single cubeneed plane, there are right angles of size 3 adjacent to corners. Since a corner should have one of the two three visible sides, then we have (3x3)/3 sides corresponding to three right angles. We can infer that the other two sides are covered by unseen corners. Now for each layer, the total number of ways it can be filled with cubes is (2x3) + (3x3). Plus, to account for the right-angled corners with sides, we should add two: two extra cubes for each layer, giving a total of (4x3 + 2) paths to cover all visible areas.


Subtotal = (2x3) + (3x3 + 4x3) = 7 x 3 = 219 cubes per layer.

The incompleteness that is not visible comprises the hexagonal base and the remaining cubic portions out of sight. For the hexagonal base, each hexagonal space has to have only one hexagonal-cut corner cubeneed cube to complete surfaces. In total, it uses (6-8/2) cubic spaces to avoid leaving cubes out. However, we do not have one cube to fool both edges (since three adjacent sides have to be cut for a hexagon) but one cube to fill two hexagons, which contributes to (6/2 = 3) cubes.
The remaining (2x3) parts that are not visible are solvable (by marking only the unseen faces with a single cubic space) with a total of (2x3 + 4x2)/4 cubes.
So, the unseen side areas require (2+4) cubes + (3+4)/4 = (2+3) cubes.
Subtotal for the visibility formation = 19 + (2+3) = 222 cubes.


Since there are four spaces (one visible) and three unseen codes of a hexagonal base per unit of cubes, the total number of cubes smartly placed is actually (1+3/3) x (1+3) x 222, which equals 1 x 4.7.
Now, when we solve the visible half with a single cubic space, which is one x three, we get (3+2) from 1 and an additional (2+3) from 3-empty corners of the hexagonal base. There are 5 unseen corners of the hexagonal base that are visible from only three adjacent sides, so to make the simultaneous appearance of a single cubic path, we get an additional four cubes, giving us (7).
The unsmartly placed are the ones we already assigned to visible edges, so we subtract two to balance cubes: 1 and subtract the hexagonal base's corner cubes:
1 - 7 = -8 cubes.
Additionally, there are 14+2 x unsmart visual areas that we placed smartly: now we subtract the hexagonal base corners left behind when we wanted cubes that got the shape. So (14+2) - (6/4) gives 10 cubes.
The total number of smartly placed finishes is (1+8+2+10 = 10), which does not very much help, but I can logically estimate it could be between zero almost to 8 non-zero cubes.
Behold, the outcome is, indeed, many cubes are missing from this puzzle."

Please answer with a just a number and nothing else ,4,mathematical_reasoning," In the image you've provided, we have two points: the point U(1,0) and point V(2,2). The slope m is given. The point V moves up by approximately 3 units when slope m changes by 6 units. So, by the time slope m changes by 6 units from 2/3 to 3/4, the vertex directly below V, which has coordinates (7/5) should appear as (3,3.5).
Here's the calculation:


Vertex directly below V(2,2) that corresponds to the time slope changes by 6 units = (1 x 6) + (2 x (6/3) / m) = (0 x 6) + (2 x 3 / 4) = (3, 3 + 2 \* 6).

84,spatial_reasoning_rotation_and_transformation_ropes_closed_2.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,Observe the following scene. How many closed shapes do the intersecting lines create? Answer with a single integer.,4,spatial_reasoning," In the image provided, there are three linear structures that could pass through the origin if we extend them:


1. The first line, which is just a horizontal line, does not intersect with any other lines, so the answer is ""0.""
2. The second line passes through the two dots, meaning it intersects with the perpendicular line to the first line to the right of the origin, and that perpendicular line passes through the dot it intersects with. We get \( \frac{x-h}{x'} - \frac{y}{h'}\), where \(h\) and \(h'\) are the slopes of adjacent sides of the second line connecting point \(d_2\) and \(d_2'\) with point \(d_1\) and \(d_1'\). Let's solve this also for \(x'\):

\[ \frac{x' - x}{h' h} = \frac{x - x''}{h''}\]
Multiply eqs to get:
\[ \frac{x'(x'' - x'}{h''h'h} = \frac{x''x'}{h xx'} = 1\]
Subtract \(x''x'/(h''h')\) from both sides:
\[ \frac{x''x'}{hxx'} - \frac{x'}{h'h'} = 1 - \frac{x''}{h'h'} \]
\[ \frac{x''}{hx'h'} - \frac{x'}{h'} = 1 - \frac{x''}{h'} \]
Simplify:
\[ \frac{hx'}{h'}(\frac{x''}{h'}(\frac{1}{x''} - \frac{1}{h''}) - \frac{x'}{h'}) = 1 - \frac{x''}{h''} \]
\[ \frac{hx'}{h'(\frac{x'^2}{h'}(\frac{1}{x''} - \frac{1}{h''}) - \frac{x'}{h'} + \frac{1}{h'}) = 1 - \frac{x''}{h''} \]
\[ \frac{hx'}{h'}(1 - \frac{x'}{h'}(\frac{1}{x''} - \frac{1}{h''}) - \frac{1}{h'}) = 1\]
Subtract \(x'\) multiplied by both numerator and denominator:
\[ \frac{hx'}{h'}(1 - \frac{1}{x''h''h'h' - \frac{x'}{h'}) = 1 \]
\[ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{x''}{h'h''h'' - x'}{h'} - \frac{h'}{x'}. \]
\[ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{x''}{h''h''} - \frac{h'}{x'}. \]
This is not in a nice form for \(x'\) and \(h'\). Revert the numerator and denominator:
\[ 1 - \frac{h'}{h'h'' - \frac{1}{he'}\]
\[ \frac{h'}{h'e'}(\frac{1}{h''e' - 1 - \frac{h'}{h''}) \]
Moreover, \(h'e' = h' + \frac{h'}{h''}\), and \(h'e' = h''\). So:
\[ \frac{h'}{h'e'} = h' + \frac{h'}{h''} \]
\[ \frac{h'}{h'e'}(\frac{1}{e'(\frac{h'}{h''} - \frac{h'}{h''} - 1)e') = 1 + \frac{h'}{h''} \]
\[ \frac{h}{h''}(\frac{1}{e'} - \frac{1}{h'}(\frac{1}{h''}) = 1 + \frac{h'}{h''\]
Subtract \(h'\) multiplied by both numerator and denominator:
\[ \frac{h}{h''}(1 - \frac{e'}{h'h'e''}\frac{1}{1} - \frac{h'}{h''} - \frac{e'}{h'}) = 1 + \frac{h'}{h''} \]
\[ \frac{1}{1 - (\frac{e'}{h'}(h'h''e'e'' - \frac{e'}{h'}) - \frac{1}{h''} - \frac{e'}{h'}) = 1 + \frac{h''}{h'} \]
\[ \frac{1 - (\frac{h'}{h'}(\frac{e'}{h'h''}e'' - \frac{e'}{h'} - \frac{1}{h'}(h'')) = 1 + \frac{h''}{h'}\]
\[ \frac{1 - \frac{1}{h'h''h'} + \frac{h''}{h'} = 1 + \frac{h''}{h'}\]
\[ \frac{h'}{h''(\frac{1 + \frac{h''}{h'} - \frac{1}{h'h'}) = 1 \]
\[ \frac{1}{1e}[\frac{h'}{e}(1 + \frac{h''}{h'} - \frac{1}{h'}] = 1 \]
\[ \frac{1}{1e[h'h''e''(\frac{1}{h'}) = 1 \]
\[ \frac{1e}{h''}(\frac{1}{h'}) = 1 \]
\[ \frac{1e}{h''h'} = 1 \]
\[ h' = \frac{e}{h''h} \]
Now, I shift the equation to the left to create the x' variable for the first equation:
\[ \frac{1}{1e}(\frac{h'}{h}x' - \frac{h'}{x''}) = 1 \]
\[ \frac{1}{1e}(h'h''\frac{x''}{x'}/h'' - (\frac{x''}{h''}) = 1 \]
\[ x'' = 1e\frac{x'}{h''} + h'' + h' + 1 \]
\[ x'' = (u'uh'' + e\frac{x'}{h''} - 1)e\frac{x'h''}{h''} + 1 \]
\[ e\frac{x'}{h''} = u'u'h'' + x'' ihnen'h' + \frac{x'h''h''}{h}'] \]
\[ x' = (1-x'')uh'' - (u'uh'' - u'eanci') \]
This equation returns two possible values: \(x' = 0\) and \(x' = 1\), but we'll need to find the correct one. To do that, note that because \(h'/h'' = x'/e'\) for combinations that pass through the origin, we can set both sides of the above equation equal to 1:
\[ 1 = (1 - x''uh'' - u'uh'' - u'eanci')(1/(x'h''h) + e)\]
Now, multiply \(eh''ev''e'\) by both sides to get:
\[ x''x'''e' = x'h'''e' + e'hshecky' = h'h'''ee'h'e' + hekshvh'ec - x'ys']
Now, the \(h'''e'e'\)-term is a parabola to the right:
\[ x''x''' -zs''xe' = h'h'''e'h'e' + eh'he eigh']
Note that the \(hs'e'\) term is on the left hand side:
\[ x''z' = (x'(h'''e'h' + ze' + 1) - (h'h'''e'h' + ehe'a') + sche'c) = 0\].
Therefore, the correct solution for \(x'\) is:
\[ x' = ash''(kh'h'eha''h'hee''ee'' \+ k' + h'k' + h'ahe'' + s'c) + ced'] \]"

The vertical coordinates of these parts correspond to three different decimal values (2.0, 0.5, and 1.0, respectively). The horizontal axis indicates the time, and the triangular waveform is characteristic of a sine or saw-tooth function, with a peak, trough, and peak points at specific intervals. The shape of the waveform changes over time, with suggestions of vaguely blue and green lines, possibly indicating rising or falling values where the sinusoidal waves approach their respective peak or trough values. To determine the nature of a time series from this graph, one must consider the domain over which the function takes values, domain scales, and frequency analysis of the component values.



The rise-velocity, trough intervals (t_r/t_p) appear to follow the 2kHz sine wave and the 2kHz tight saw-tooth pattern for the `\alpha`, whereas the blue (rise) and {module} FOR THE STATION NAME (value) are much larger than the green borders, suggesting that the velocity domain is either faster and the timeout is too. The red (fall) portions are only briefly depicted and suggest only a brief 'stuff' trough at a faster 2kHz rate over a wider domain. The walk rates are much slower (2kHz) and the domain is not far from the complete width of the graph. This pattern could occur thoughtfully with {module out of STATION NAME} where {best} and nominal domain are closer.



For the frequency domain of the waveform, there are two different peak frequencies in saw-tooth waveforms which imply extra behavior to wave modes but could suggest some physical variables meeting each other. The ragged pattern of the saw-tooth function suggests there are other timescales where it does not screw or it's a low value, so {module name shifts its domain} rapidly over time. The time domain scalings do not change much, so there's more symmetrical forcing of horsepower in the signal. A calculated peak to peak interval is approximately around 0.7kHz.



So, the waveform could be a combination of a motor and a generator on the same or different stations. The physics principles of the sentiments are not clear, and so best nature suggests key current pulses are indeed grouped. The synchro mechanism that takes half the day is not part of the function yet requires this function to be central clocking/synchronization. The function can be used to correct cadence."

In the setup, the balls are weighted to allow them to bounce and spin in different directions. The initial startle action from the balls introduces a spin and bounce. As the internal friction within the ball is counterbalanced by centrifugal force, it causes them to spin rapidly. Maintaining the spinning motion and avoiding the needle is the main goal of the juggler. They must use their skill and dynamic motion to quickly move their body while keeping a consistent rhythm with the incoming balls to control the stick, leading them away from the needle.

Please answer with just a number and nothing else ",2612736,mathematical_reasoning," The video is a demonstration of how to solve a simple combinatorial problem using theezation fact. The speaker goes through the steps of lining up the C as a row, dividing it into 2, and using the counting principle to show how many elements are in each group according to the examples given. Here's a breakdown of what's expicitly shown in the video:

- They line up C as a row and divide it into two sets, with the first set being cell (1, 3, 5) and the second set being cell (2) according to the problems asked to be solved.
- The speaker then computes the number of ways to choose one element from the first set and finds one way (1), which is the first element in the first set.
- Next, the same is applied to the second set, which is set 1, and the problem shows the number of ways to choose an element from this set. The speaker solves and finds two possibilities (2), indicating the two elements in the first set.
- The speaker points out that there are C(2) ways to choose an element from the second set since it's just one element breaking into two parts of equally probable parts.
- To calculate the number of possibilities in one set, the speaker solves the problem 2 ways before choosing the first element of the first set.
- Now there are still C(9) different combinations left to divide.
- The **counting principle** is utilized, and the speaker states that the number of ways to choose a second element from the first set (without having already made a choice of the first) is C(9) and subsequently shows two ways to choose this second element.
- Then, the speaker demonstrates the choice after the first can be C(3) without any preference.
- To form a complete set, the speaker just subtracts one element from the first set from the second (since the first element is already selected), leaving C(8) combinations.
- The speaker computes the number of combinations in the second set by not choosing the second element first.
- They calculate the third combination (using counting principle) in the second set, resulting in C(8)
- Lastly, the number of combinations in the second set without any preference for the first set element is C(8).

- Having already made two choices, each combination differs from two, resulting in (8!-2!), giving C(7).

- Finally, the speaker adds the first set with its combination examples and the second set without first element and finds 10 ways, which is the answer to the given question, and this covers all combinations of the second set without any preference.
- They go through the process of adding the remaining combinations and explain it to the camera, which shows that the solution was the most straightforward.
- To summarize, the video discusses the method of counting based on combination, 3, the principle of combination, and categorization. It's a useful technique for counting without the number of distinct configurations based on how you want the choices to be done, which is really handy in solving many combinatorial problems."

Answer with one multiple choice option.,A,spatial_reasoning," In the given image, there is a dodecahedron with a colorful pattern on it, and another four blocky objects, which could be either cubes or plastic containers. To determine which cube matches the pattern you would expect to be cut in each corner, observe the following:


1. Corner 7: The cube with a color in this corner would match corner 7 on the dodecahedron.

2. Corner 2: The cube with 1 dark color on one half (let's distinguish this as cube A) would match the dark part of the pattern and the cube with no color (let's distinc)t as cube B) would match the plain one.
3. Corner 8: In this case, the cube with no pattern ( cube A) would match the corner and the cube with the dark part of the pattern (cube B) would match the plain corner 8.
4. Corner 4: Edge 4 on square cube A would match the edge 4 on the dodecahedron.

5. Corner 1: There are two possibilities here, but one might be the double cube, as it consists of one plain part and one with a color, made by flipping the cube; the cube A would match the one part without a color, and the cube B would be the flat-faced part.
6. Edge 6: Remember cube A. Edge 6 on either corner has to match the dark part of both the six-sided cube, which means cube A. B is the other flat-faced edge.
7. Edge 5: Cube A is the flat-faced edge that would match the dark part of corners 1, 3, and 4 and the edges 7-9. Cube B would match the plain-faced corners and edges.
8. Edge 12: This is similar to edge 3 and follows the same pattern.
9. Corner 3: This is the most complex since you have a choice of three possibilities. Cube A might be a double color without a color, cube B could use the flat-faced part, and the cube C might be the flipped cube, but both should not be reflecting colorfully-patterned from the corner. Cube A would be plain-faced with a dark part that matches corner 5, cube B would match corner 2, and then cube C as flipped.


Therefore, to match the color pattern of the corner you'd expect to see on the corner of each cube, you need to choose cube A for the ones without color (except for corner 4, 7, where you have to choose cube B), and on corner 5 you need to choose cube C."

One way to compute the integral involves using the area under the curve rule, which includes properly considering the initially steep slope before it approaches zero.

The question asks what comes next with the primary color, purple, and the secondary color is not provided. Therefore, the next question would be: ""What color comes next with the primary color purple?""


To create an image using this color scheme, we would need to consider the modes for mixing these primary and secondary colors to obtain all colors. The primary mode for magenta includes:
- Red mode - P: Pure red
- B: Bio logical teal
- M: Mingermellon
- Y: No yellow (as the first impression is confusing but it is a varying shade of purple)

119,spatial_reasoning_rotation_and_transformation_ropes_count_2.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,Observe the following scene. How many lines are drawn in the video? Answer with a single integer.,4,spatial_reasoning," The video displays a series of mathematical functions used to model specific conditions in video game ""Diablo 2."" The sequences of equations presented describe an element's time to spawn in a dungeon scenario, with the different criteria as 'no spawn', 'single spawn', and 'normal spawn'. It's a play on the concept of recursion due to the initial case being the base case, leading to different types of monsters spawning after the initial spawn event.


The base case might involve a sequence where only one monster spawner spawns, a single spawn could be one monster spawning spawning, and a normal spawn typically means several different monsters spawning. Each of the different spawning types involves an initial case monster spawning, so the question starts by asking about this initial case. The mathematical functions that model this concept have an initial condition where the base case becomes the immediate monster spawner, guiding the spawning of a single monster in the single-spawn case and leading to the normal spawn case, which hangs from both the single and normal spawn cases.


To apply a finite difference approximation involving floating-point arithmetic, the time units are given, and this introduces an if/else condition to apply the form f(small, base case) or base case to the onesider δt. The algebraic form used here appears to be an exponentiation of the difference δt and a resulting difference of δt for an initial case (gross) multiplied by the smaller base case effect to get the gossamer effect, a nuanced statement for being small. A bit later, the formula is also declared and exercised across cases single and normal, which is not provided here openly, suggesting a compound-and-like operation. The video no doubt provides more details on the equations and a way to apply them to understand the exact nature of the spawn sequence across different scenario conditions.


The use of floating-point arithmetic is critical in differentiating between one-step approximations, necessitating a thin change, in the limited-time framing of the initial process' running time 'Δt', to repeat for longer processes in the stationary base case ... which seems to require Δt's and makes it an iff condition that switches into the base case and the onesider 50. ...


The video's focus is on the different spawning scenarios and the processes or the models that explain how the spawning influenced the processes rather than offering a clear hint on ways to debug the arrived result or play with the subjects of digital tools."

Answer with only the color name.,purple,spatial_reasoning," To find the color of a particular linear part through transformation, it is necessary to draw a transformed coordinate system on a color coordinate plane and then identify the color of the section between that transformed linear line. To unambiguously determine a color's location on a color coordinate plane, it is essential to determine the RGB values in each color channel. The process for finding this example might involve the following steps:


1. Starting at the given initial view, rotate the point to gather information on the coordinate system within the bbox to understand its position.
2. Once the point moves out of the bbox with no overlapping areas, a new plane with half the size of the previous plane appears and separate parts.
3. Move to a larger surface to maintain the remaining coordinate system and repeat the process until the entire transformation of the linear part is visible.
4. Finally, repeat steps 1-3 with the transformed points that specify a smaller plane, as linear sections come into the view. This ensures all transformations of the linear part is complete, showing the edges in full display, and helps Ruby or transforming code knows exactly the exact changes to make.

5. Once the entire linear part has all its information, find the color-coordinates with the colors in 'rgb' r channel for all locations from the smaller sections.
6. Until you mine with the bottom-like point (the final point) running out of the transformation.
7. Unique colors are colored together, so you should have a compilation provided or the information about colors per frame or per side, will result in a report with a table to show every couplet color and what color it is.

8. If you are reach the source shape, open your area.
9. If the test changes to move, move it to the xalpha test or xyalpha with the new how canvas, so it's ready to go beyond the current size bounds.
10. Determine the window that proved the linear part with the optimum color palette and convert xH and xA locate its minute and maximum values from one another.

111. Perform all xH and yA cuts, judging by z.
12. Draw all points of transformation on the new plane. Minimum and maximum values are rarely within the bounds.
13. The window that is six over three parts has many colors and is more ridged between these three, then find unique min to three while providing shading between.
14. Take 6 and 7 for Bezier curves because of the lines. Convert that to a completely infinite color palette for this window.
15. Importantly, all lines above and curved from the specification point do not match the determining point. This creates one identifier by adjusting."

Output the answer rounded to 2 decimal places.,1.9,mathematical_reasoning," The video shows two high-dimensional endpoints or coordinates being plotted against each other, using the inverse of the exponential function to apply scaling. The x-axis represents a horizontal endpoint, and the y-axis represents a vertical endpoint. The equation of the line is \( \frac{y}{x} \leftarrow x^{-1/\alpha} \), where \( \alpha \) is a variable that can scale the axes. The scaling factors can be determined by finding the reciprocal of the slopes of the line, as shown by the video where the slopes at the two high-dimensional endpoints are the inverses of each other. This should be done on a graphing calculator. The graph indicates that \( x^{-1/\alpha - 1} \) is the x-axis and \( y^{-1/\alpha} \) is the y-axis. With \( y \) being the vertical axis and \( x \) the horizontal axis, the equation is then \( \frac{y}{x} \leftarrow y^{-1/\alpha - 1 \to x^{-1/\alpha} \) and the end points can be multiplied by \( x^{-1/\alpha - 1 \) to get \( \alpha. \) The two equations should add up to 1, which means the values must be reciprocals of each other. This system of equations centers at \( \alpha = -1 \).


To calculate the reciprocal of the slope, first clear the graphing area, input the y=axis and x=1, then set x=1 and y=b, then set x=b and y=a, the reciprocal of the last equation. Finally, set the y-value to 0 and use a=x and b=y to find \( \frac{0}{0} = a^{-1/\alpha-1 \to y^{-1/\alpha} \), which leads to \(\alpha = 1\).

However, the given equations are:\


P(t) = m * v^2 * r*{t^2 - sqrt(t)}
E(t) = E(s^2) + V_a + R_s * P(t) - Elogic(s)


The energy is defined over two parts, one by energy in the incomplete cycle and one by energy in the complete cycle. Therefore, the change in energy must be found, which is:

Answer with only one multiple choice option.,D,spatial_reasoning," In the video, there's a representation of a 3D shape shown as a box with six sides and four cubes on top. To explain what happens when this 3D shape is rotated around one of its vertical axes (primary or secondary) by a certain angle, the statement writes ""shapes the same as the one shown with only one multiple choice option,"" which means if we view the vertical axis as a 1 dimension to represent all angles and the box as a 2D version, that corresponds to the initial 3D shape. It then rotates the 3D shape, and the 2D version now represents the new shape formed, which is different due to the rotation along the vertical axis, ""r"" being different from the original 3D version. Now, if r is divided by 6, then the a certain angle rotates the 3D shape in the x-z plane, which is another way to say it rotates it around a secondary vertical axis, and we get a new 2D version corresponding to that angle. This new 2D version is different from the initial 2D shape and the 2D version corresponding to r equals 360. The situation highlights that a 3D rotation affects the 2D representation while a 2D rotation doesn't change the 3D shape, and mixing these together in the paragraph becomes the subject."
135,abstract_reasoning_logical_reasoning_arcagi2_combined_a395ee82_count.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,How many dark red squares should appear in the output grid? Answer with a single integer,430,abstract_reasoning," This image shows a set of transformation rules and a checkerboard-like pattern where each transformation seems to shift the pattern from a source square to a corresponding target square. There are four rules displayed at the top, which describe movements of template squares. The units may add to or subtract from the value of adjacent squares in different directions. For example, the top-right square has moved one step diagonally to the left. The red squares seem to stay in the same place while the white unit moves towards each unit. White units have moved one square each (up and down) towards the pattern, while the blue unit stays in the center. There is no color pattern to follow for the next generation in the source positions. The fourth rule of movement involves only the blue unit in both directions. One-step diagonally left and right from the blue unit with boundaries different.


At the bottom, there is a checkerboard with two types of units. Each source square has a number. Using the rules above to the left, the movement creates a pattern with similar such squares. The numbered squares seem to stay in the same positions in the final pattern. The dark squares add to the color squares while the lighter units (red, pink, or yellow) subtract from them, and this explanation of the pattern is then tested for the numbered squares, with question marks indicating missing that pattern in the checker.


Based on the rules and the generation diagram above, one must continue the pattern for the dark squares to recreate the same checks. By using the rules given above, one can determine that there are combinations of additions and subtractions, with the boundaries of the units shifting control how they move. The question mark indicates that one check on the right of the given pattern doesn't appear to be part of the pattern, so a solution would involve finding a way to create that check pattern with the numbered squares and their destinations consistent with the rules. The solution would involve moving the numbers one or two places, incorporating the addition of the darker and lighter units, and the subtraction of those units in the appropriate manner to match the checkerboard pattern."

Answer with one multiple choice option.,c,abstract_reasoning," The two color scheme-generated patterns shown in the image are a pattern-column swap and a gradient.


The pattern-column swap is a process where each element of the second column of a n x n grid pattern is compared with each element of the first column to produce n x n new patterns. This new pattern is a rotation of a given n x n grid, and each element in a new pattern is obtained by rotating the corresponding element of a given pattern in the (n - 1) x n grid position and swapping it with another element of the same (n - 1)-th column to produce a n x n grid pattern like this: [1 2 3 4 5 2 1 6 4 3 1 5] becomes [1 6 2 4 1 2 5 3 6 1 4].


The gradient shows the process of pattern replacement, where color tones are transferred from right to left column by replacing a color-toned patch with one of the same color tone but different tones in each n x n grid position. This new pattern with opposite tones in the new column will look like this: [0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0] becomes [1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0], and so on for all combinations of color tones.

153,mathematical_reasoning_statistical_reasoning_table_methods_dissapearing_rows_colq_1.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,How many methods in the table achieve an ADE20K score higher than 78.37? Please answer with a just a number and nothing else ,1,mathematical_reasoning," This video demonstrates various situations where process A (A6) is used to counterattack against adversarial actions or attacks against drones. It is divided into methods on the table and methods on the bottom part of the screen. On the table, we see three methods that are next to a drone for protection purposes, and it appears that more than one might be applied. One for a duplicate A6 check, this is a positive algorithm with A6, then a negation of A6, then selecting `CL35` which is the negated A6, and a ""CL3"" check, possibly an algorithm denoting a negated version of A6.


Below that, methods on the bottom part seem to be different counterattacking attacks from the drone against enemies. The processes and facts listed show that the negated `epsilon6K` is for protection and negated `text K`.


Based on this, we can deduce that:
- For protecting against an adversarial action from a drone, a positive ""epsilon6K"" A6 check is applied, meaning the drone would be A6.
- The negated ""epsilon6K"" is the negation of ""A6,"" which indicates negated drone operations for protection.
- The ""CL3"" check could be an algorithm for counterattacking ""A6"".
- ""CL3"" against an adversarial action or enemy might not be the exact counterattack to A6 but possibly another related operation involving both adversarial actions or an attack on key K.
- The ""CJ4"" check would be performing an algorithm, considering it's possible to be a standalone operation against adversarial actions or an attack on K.


In each of these methods, A6 is implied, which might indicate that the systems are nefariously interfering with or counteracting with each other. For example, if the drone is executing the A6 A6 check, it likely means that it is an adversary, while if it's the negated, then it's the adversary declined or responding to A6.
It's crucial to note that some key understanding of the specific context, intentions, or activation of the systems is lacking, and these are just interpretations based on the provided information and general possible intentions of such operations."

Please answer with a just a number and nothing else ,4,mathematical_reasoning," The image and description provided are of a completing a square, and a graph indicate a mathematical concept of simultaneous amplitude modulation (SAM), which is applied to the RE of two IGs. The two IGs have the same amplitude but amplitude modulation can be applied simultaneously by applying constant demodulation phase shifters. To complete the square technique is used.


It seems there's a discussion taking place between two people, although only one of them is saying ""completing a square,"" and the other one is saying ""points on Ro,"" with an arrow pointing at a square and a graph in the upper left corner of the image pointing at points on Ro. The demodulation phase shifters are likely being discussed as they shift the phase of the IGs, and the completing a square is a technique used to synchronize the two oscillations for demodulation. The two-tone amplitudes might need to be compared and matched for synchronization or interference analysis or another technical explanation that is related to communication or signal processing.


If this is for educational purposes, the video probably explains how to compare two IGs for demodulation purposes (as if they were two tones) when their phase can actually be synchronized for communication, while the other person might be focusing on adjusting the demodulation phase. This method seems to be highlighted for digital processing in cable networks, possibly for optimizing signal transmission fidelity, SI detection, or signal crest factor adjustments for transmitters/demodulators.

Choose the graph that best describe the position of the object after fall",A,physical_reasoning," The image shows a calculation where we are expected to solve for Δy. Unfortunately, the moment of inertia is actually missing its capital letter, described as 'I', but it's still recognizable as the quantity that needs to be manipulated to find 'Δy'. The expression provided in the image represents the relationship between the acceleration Δv (due to a torque generated by a turning radius of r), and rotational velocity Δω. The given value for the moment of inertia (I) is 8 kg·m²/s² and the angular acceleration (ω₂) is 10 rad/s² at the moment of rotation (r=0.2 kg·m). The calculation shows that as the torque increases, the rotational velocity must also increase, but what is not provided explicitly is that the moment of inertia needs to increase at a corresponding rate to maintain the rotation characteristic. First, let's calculate the relationship between torque and rotational velocity for the given moment of inertia:


τ = Δv * r


Given: Δv = 10.05 N·m, r = 0.2 kg·m, so:
τ = 10.05 N·m * 0.2 kg·m = 2 kg·m


Now, let's find the relationship between the moment of inertia and the moment of inertia:
Δv = ω₂ * r²

Given: Omega₂ = 10 rad/s², Δω = (r * ω₂/dt = dtस = 0.01 s)
r² ≈ 0.08 kg·m²

Substituting Δω and r:
I = ω₂ * r²
8 kg·m² = ω₂ · 0.0.2 kg·m

whence, ω₂ = 4 rad/s, which might be what's meant. Now the calculation would be:

Δω = r * ω₂/dt = ω₂/r

0.01 s ≈ 4 rad/s


Finally, find Δy:
Δy = ω₁ - ω₂
0.01 s ≈ 4.0 rad/s - 4 rad/s


So, Δy ≈ 0.001 rad/s, which is approximately 0.01 s. However, this doesn't match with the result shown in the image, where the given calculated angular acceleration is 10 rad/s² and the moment of inertia is given, and the torque is also provided at 0.2 kg·m. If the calculation is meant to give a motor torque to create 10 rad/s acceleration, the moment of inertia also needs to be 10 kg·m² to maintain the constant rotational velocity at 10 rad/s. Most likely this mistake emanates from misinterpretation or an oversight in the question or context."

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to begin solving this maze:


1. Select a starting point: The numbers on the edges of the grid can be used as starting points, but as none of them are adjacent to other numbers, we must pick one at random since any starting point is equally effective. If I were to do it intuitively, I would select either (3,3).
2. Move up or right from the starting point: Move from the starting point (3,3) by one unit in either the x or y direction (up or right) to reach the adjacent blank area with numbers `(4,3)`. Here's the first move: (5,3) is chosen.

3. Move either up or right from the new position: Since new points now have a value in two directions, you can choose an adjacent spot that has unspecified numbers. Go by `(2,3)` and there you'll find the number `(6,3)`.
4. Move either up or right from `(2,3)`: To reach `(3,2)`, an adjacent unspecified `(4,2)` point to the right.
5. Now, choose an initially unspecified point `(1,2)` to the left and up to reach `(2,1)`.
6. Move right from `(2,1)` to complete the maze: The last valid direction is `(1,1)`. Go from (2,1) to (1,1) and the maze is solved. The sequence of moves creates a square with numbers (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5,2), (2,3), and (2, 1).


The maze completion with marked moves:
(3,3)   ------- Fir st Move
(4,3)   ------- Second Move
(5,3)   ------- Third Move
(2,3)   ------- Final Move

",A,temporal_reasoning," In the video, two wooden boxes are seen in front of a robot with various items placed inside, including papers, wires, a pen, some rectangular vehicles, and possibly other objects. The camera moves around the robots arms and the corners of this area in pull-out. The first task involves activating the robot's arms and makes it reach inside the box on the right. Once inside, the robot picks up a piece of white paper and places it in front. Instructions for the second task are given.


The explanations of tasks are:
1. In the wooden box, there are vehicles placed. The robot's task is to place some of the vehicles from the wooden box to the one-part wooden box below it, then pick up the sheet of white paper inside the one-part wooden box and put it in front of itself.
2. Now the papers move from the one-part wooden box and stack them at the lower corner of the two-part wooden box to the top of it.
3. The robot fills the one-part wooden box with the materials from a stack of rectangular materials and closes the door on the one-part wooden box.
4. The robot picks up a vehicle from the one-part wooden box, and with its other arm, plucks a device from the box in front of it.

5. The vehicle moves from the one-part wooden box to the two-part wooden box.
6. Then, the robot takes two more devices, one from the one-part wooden box and one from the other (two-part wooden) box and stacks them on the top of this box.
7. The robot plucks a device from the one-part wooden box placed in front of it, turns, and then spins and gets another item inside the box behind it, next to a sheet of white paper where it was before.
8. It continues to collapse the two-part wooden box.

9. There is a wire that the robot holds and moves the sides, then it goes inside the one-part wooden box at its top, turns, then picks up a pen, and places the pen beside itself.
10. Filling up the one-part wooden box behind the pen from the behind box with materials and closing the door.
111. The pen moves from the one-part wooden box to the another one below it, which is one-part wooden. Turning the two-part wooden box. 12. The robot takes a device from the one-part wooden box and unrolls it only a bit and stacks it in front of the one-part wooden box below the above device picking the pen.
The short hand concludes with closing the door on the one-part wooden box above.

167,mathematical_reasoning_algebraic_reasoning_Heat_Equation_heat_equation_2.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,What is the thermal diffusivity constant k? Choose the letter of the correct answer:,B,mathematical_reasoning," The heat equation shown in the image represents the relationship between some variables during the process of distillation or heat transfer of water at varying temperatures. The equation is:
dQ=hA(Th - Ts)dT=1+hA(Ts - Ts)\theta\frac{dQ}{Ts} = hA(Th - Ts)dT = 1 + hA(Ts - Ts)\theta



Here’s what every term in the equation stands for:
- Q: The heat that is being transferred per unit of time in the distillation process
- dQ/dt: The time rate of heat transfer in the process
- hA: The heat conductivity of the material
- dT/dt: The rate of temperature change at the surface

- Th: The temperature of the hot side
- Ts: The temperature of the cold side
- theta: The change in temperature

This equation indicates that the heat transfer rate is equal to the sum of the conductivity across the hot and cold temples times the temperature difference, minus a term representing the work input required to heat the hot side, divided by the area of the hot side."""""

E. Random",A,spatial_reasoning," The direction of rotation of the flywheel is clockwise. This is so because, in this scenario, the colours on the flywheel start from a top lexicographical order and travel clockwise around each other, with the white and white colour swapping positions when the flywheel rotates one position. Thus, when the white colour moves to a lower position, the black colour moves to an upper position. If the flywheel rotated in the opposite direction, the identical pattern would appear with a lower lexicographical order and not one part would move at all, which goes against the principle of rotation. So, therefore, the direction of rotation is clockwise, and the flywheel will move from right to left."

Your answer should only be a number (e.g. 1).",9,planning_reasoning," To solve this problem of tying a knot with a loop or two and untie it without passing the rope through your body, you can use the following approach:


1. First, cut or mark through the intersection of the rope where both strands meet.
2. Then, make either a knot with one strand or tie a simple knot with both strands.
3. Pass the end of the marked strand through the center of the knot or simple knot to ensure that it is tightly secured.
4. Untie the knot by gently pulling on the end of this mark strand.


If you have more than two strands, you can also tie one strand at the junction and then continue tying by looping over the second strand, passing it under or through the first strand, then over the second strand, to form a knot. Also, pass the end of the loops through the center so that it is secure.

5. Untie this knot by gently pulling on the end of the strand that is looped over the center.


For a knot with one strand, simply pass it through the center of the intersection and tie it securely. Then, pass the end through the loop, and pull on it to untie.


If you have two strands, tie one strand securely and the other tightly through the other strand's middle. If done correctly, this will lead to a simple knot. By gently pulling on the end of the strand tied securely, you can untie it."

The process of tying a series of knots is often done in seafishing or boating to secure the boat to a fixed object to keep it steady and prevent drifting away from its intended course. There are several techniques to create such knots, such as joining two or three ropes together and looping them through their centers, or wrapping them around another rope and tucking in the loops to create a fastening point. Examples of such knots include the reef knot, the cleat knot, the figure-eight knot, the turkshead knot, and the square knot. These knots shift the position of the rope along its axis and can minimize slippage from the fixed object. After the knots are loosened before the boat starts drifting again, they usually evoke detheking and rewind the body of rope back."

186,abstract_reasoning_logical_reasoning_arcagi2_combined_a25697e4_count.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,How many blue squares should appear in the output grid? Answer with a single integer,17,abstract_reasoning," The problem in the provided image shows a matrix of size 3x3, and the task is to determine which triangle is the given triangle (marked in red) underneath the grid. To solve this problem, we can consider the different points of the triangle and how the grid might affect those points in a unique way compared to the rest of the grid. It is clear that if two rows or two columns both intersect the point, the point failively lies inside those two rows or columns. If it's a point in the top or bottom row, then the top or bottom diagonal would intersect this point, which is important as the top and bottom rows always share the same vertex in a 3x3 grid.


Looking at the points within those two rows, we would have one point on the diagonal of the top or the bottom from the original triangle. For example, if the red triangle is below the right most grid, and considering only rightmost grid, operator predicts the position of bottommost point, the top left of the top most triangle, and bottom left of the grids in this row. However, this is also a part of the grid. Now, we need to refer to the top or the bottom diagonal of the topmost or the bottommost triangle. The top-right below the least grid predicts bottom right of the topmost triangle but also is part of the grid, sharing the point. With this information, bottom-right of the least grid shares its corner with bottom grid, the bottom right also shares a corner with an (x2) grid visible below it.


Smaller point is on the bottom right, but any corner of this grid also shares a corner with bottom of the triangle. So the bottom of the grid below the least grid separates the upper row points from the original triangle, Bottom left of the grid is also with a corner of the bottom grid, but with red triangle below, it is with the top. Bottom right of the (x2) grid below it shares bottom right of the original red triangle.


To locate these points, start by looking at the bottom-left corner of the least grid as it shares a corner with the topmost triangle, and the bottom-right corner must match the top boundary of the (x2) grid, as it intersects bottom right of that. The topmost triangle has a corner in top-left of the grid, which matches its diagonal. So bottom left of this diagonal, which intersects the bottom row, is part of the lowest grid. Meanwhile, the least grid predicts bottom middle of the triangle, so it is part of top right of the (x2) grid that intersects it, and bottom of the topmost triangle.


To conclude, although the grid is distorted and there are pointing errors, we can apply the rule that strict corners of the (x1) and (x2) grids shrink simultaneously into an upper or lower corner. Thus, we can localize the lesser grid at a point to the top right and the exact corner of the (x2) grid in the topmost triangle. Since the top boundary of the grid only intersects one diagonal of the triangle whence the red triangle lies, the least grid should fit inside it. With all of these clues, and considering points in different grids, the least grid should share the top-right diagonal, and so should the entire chain, which is a point in the bottom-left corner, with the boundary of the topmost triangle.


The entire process implies strict pixel values of some kind not depicted in the grid as nothing can divide points and anything that only intersects a single row or column undivides two points into two. Therefore, checking these edges with precise pixel values, the points of red triangle can be narrowed down to fit inside these 2x1 and 2x2 grids. The most compact pattern is 3x1 grid (centre also in the topmost triangle) and then the points just fit into at least or the topmost 3x1 grids, the unshaded blocks at the place where all the diagonals meet."

Average Weight Watchers POINTS = 21.6 / (1 + 0.9 / 10.19 AP)


21.6 is 19 / 10.19 AP ≈ 1


Another point to note, in APR they are issued at standard.


Therefore, the average POINTS from the given information is: Abergele Points 1, CLEM Points 3, Burton Points 0, Coca Cola Points 0 1, Limavady Points 0, Malbridge Points 2, OHAL Points 2, Portsmouth Points 1, Preston Points 3, Rooseby Points 3, Stirling Points 5, Storred Points 1, Wythenshaia Points 12.

1 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 17 POINTS



So, the answer can also be found by using the direct addition method if you don't want to go through the conversion process:

17 POINTS ÷ 10.19 AP = 2.16


So, the Watchers Points are 2.16.

Answer with one multiple choice option.,D,spatial_reasoning," The content of the video does not provide a clear question to answer. However, if we assume that the question being asked is about the reasoning behind the shape or concept of the cube shown in the image, it would be:


""What geometric attributes contribute to the cube's shape, and what are the specific forces acting on each cube face, and how do these forces affect the cube's structure and stability?""


To address this question, one would examine the cube's six faces, each one of which forms a right angle, and the six edges that connect the faces; they share a common perpendicular three-dimensional line segment, perpendicular to a plane through-the-cube. The edges pull on the faces, creating pressure on the cube from six distinct directions. The forces act at right angles to the cube's faces, juxtaposing a linear ratio (equal angles) between the interval and the length of 6 parallel edges. The cube is balanced in each dimension by these forces, ensuring stability and mutual support held by each edge in a fixed position. The precise distribution of both forces and angles varies, contributing to its three-dimensional stability while also maintaining the proper form."

They are both important in the field of fractal geometry and have been studied for their patterns and self-similarity. The Koch curve is formed, starting with a cube, then continually splitting off and choosing one of the four faces to fashion the next face, while the Sierpinski gasket is created by folding the original triangle and then copying and rotating the bounding box. In the formula for the Koch curve, x^2(2^n-1) and x could represent the dimensions of the lattice; in this case, they are (1^2, 1^2). For the Sierpinski gasket, 2^(n) is the number of rotations (left) and n might represent nested proportions, and (n+1)^2 is the size of the rotation box on the base of the second generation."

(Choose the closest answer, give just the letter)",A,mathematical_reasoning," The mathematical problem provided shows that the variable 'x' represents the area of cooperative consumer space number '2', and 'y' represents the area of the a competitive consumer space. The consumer rate for a slaborty umber is inversely related to 'y^3', rather than what is directly related to 'y'. To solve this problem, we need to let 'y' = 'y^3 x y'. This would imply that the area of consumer space 'y' is directly proportional to 'y^3 x y' (not 'y').


Since Euler's Method Problem cannot directly provide the value for 'y^3', we also cannot assume 'y^3 x y'. However, we can find 'y' and then substitute it into the equation 'y x' to overcome this obstacle. If we substitute 'y' = 0.30 x' we get 'y = 0.30.30'. Then, the numerator would become '0.30 x'. Using proper indices, the area of Cooperative Consumer space, 'y', at that point would be proportional to 'y' = losely (Σy * 'y'). Let 'y' = 0.30 + σy'. Both 'y' (0.30) and 'σy' (0.16) now are positive, and the index is 0.6 after setting this down in base 3, which corresponds to getting √y (√3).
This means that the slope of a cooperative space is about 3 due to this point. The slope of the bitter space is 0 and the value for 'y^3' which is calculated as 'y' on a molar slope is a value of 3. Step back, setting a molar slope of 0.6 to 0: the 'y' that we got becomes 0.6' (√3-0.16) and 'σy' (√3+0.16) and the slope in base 3 becomes 2.6: an interesting slope of (-3/2).
Using the Proper indices, we can now find out the utilization 'u' = 0.30' and the quantum 'q' for the cooperative units, subtracting that (τxq = 1/3) from the analogy of the Denominator (τ (1-0.16/(2-0.6)) which leaves (τ/3).
The proper shape comes out to be Natural shape of 'v' of 2.125: (sum of slopes of cooperative and competitive spaces will add up to 4.1), from the specified 3. Let 6 divide 4.1 by 6 to get 3/2, and solve for values of 'y' and 'x'. Rounding, 'y' is about three and 'x' is about a 1.56 (the power of 2).
Holding this rounded answer, a cooper and a competitive constancy come closer than the cooperative space's.
Now, let 'y' and 'x' define the determination on the basis of this proportion. The cooperative space rate uses areas of 'y' proportionally to 'y', so the hostile (√y) of 2.125 increases to (√2 × 2), and the competitive also rises 3/2 because it has a rest, but fixes the ratio (√y to √2 which enters about 4).
An interesting conclusion is that all the coefficients of competitive space all equal 1, while the coefficient of the cooperative space is about 4. The cooperative space is 4 times as long as the competitive space in base 3 while we get the ratios 4 from the bitterness. The ratios are about 2.1. While some 'Faith' calls for COOPER, some calls hit the competitive space.
It seems that the competitive space is about 2, but it's only about 1 in reality. The 'Faith' answer is inaccurate. The two spaces cannot be equate because where Faith' probably defined it wrongly, and now we have an error: ""2/3."" The answer now goes through 1/1 in another 'Faith', making it about 3. Accurate."

So pink appears twice in the first 6 positions.


The second color from the list is purple, and we're given that it appears three times in another line. Since we're already done with pink, we will repeat the multiplication process:
Purple \* 3 = 3x
3x = 9
Another color we need to check is yellow. Pink is still unused, so for the first 6 positions, yellow appears twice in the third line: 2 from the start.
For the second 6 positions, yellow doesn't appear, so we multiply yellow by the number in those remaining positions \* 3: 3y \*3 = 9
Finally, it turns out that yellow appears 9 times in the first 6 positions and thrice in the second 6 positions, so its total number is 9.


The third color is yellow and appears 9 times in 6 positions from the second list. You add the number of positions it appears to the note above to get the total.
The total number of appearances is also 9.
So the count is the same for the first six places, and 3x+3 for the second six places, which makes 12."
225,abstract_reasoning_logical_reasoning_arcagi2_combined_4a21e3da_mc.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,Which output grid should follow? Answer with one multiple choice option.,c,abstract_reasoning," The image in the video contains different colored blocks in a grid, along with an instruction on the bottom left labeled ""Observe following lines..."" On the grid, two main lines are indicated: one blue (the lower one that goes from top to bottom) and a red line that crosses it diagonally. It appears that each line knows at the second colored block it reaches. The process could be explained by considering whether any block has another block directly above or below it based on the color of its second coordinate. Since the blue line creates crossing points with the red line, it should also intersect or have another block directly above or below for the second blue block it reaches. This means it stops at the red line. The process can be confirmed by looking ahead by the distribution of these blocks."

Answer with a single integer,337,abstract_reasoning," The image presented has different colors of wavy shapes that are oriented at an oblique angle with respect to each other. These colors include dark, light, red, green, and blue. The shapes within the red and the blue areas are concentric and symmetrical, and there seems to be a transition from dark to light where an arrow points to the red from outside to inside. The light area is below a dark area, representing a dark square within a dark square, and there is a convergence of a light square within a dark area towards a red and blue area, which is within another square. To the right, a squiggly arrow starts at an arrow's end and leads from the dark to a red area within the dark red, which might be no squares either, or could wiggle through the grid of the grid and skipping the squares where those high points occur - there are double sets of red squares. This can be completed using a logical sequence of squares. The question is asking to color any portion of each of these wavy shapes as dark or its diametric opposite (e.g., red inside or its shadow) using complete symmetry, suggested that all forces pass through a and b and via routes.

The game being displayed features a 3D model cube with numbers on all sides, and as per the context given in the description, it appears that the numbers are rotated in such a way that they are pointing upwards. This means that the number 1 would point into the topmost surface and the number 6 would point into the bottommost surface. When rotated, the number 3 would point towards the side, and when viewed from up close, the number 7 would point inward (as 6 would be inward-facing, while 1 and 2 would point outward and 3 would continue to the edges, 8 pointing outward and matching 1 and 2's rotation pattern). Therefore, when the cube is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, the number 1 would still be on the surface it was originally on, and numbers 2 and 3 would be on the faces that were previously the sides, and number 8 would be now on the other surface."

Your answer should only be a number (e.g. 1).",0,planning_reasoning," The image you have provided shows a rope tied into eight loops with a knot at the end. There's a tricky aspect to this problem, and it's not immediately evident from the picture. Each loop has a different degree of kinking depending on the angle at which the rope is tied. To tie the knot, six loops are tied at the exact same degree (180°, 90°, or 108°). This means that if you look at the knot from above, the two loops on the outside of the others are tied at 660°, the two below are at 108°, and the two on the ones below are at 0°. To retain this configuration perfectly, you need to fix the knot so that these six loops are also tied at the same angle of 60°. The angles on the inside loops are also relevant to the ones on the outside, as those on the right loops should be mirrored by the loops before them. Think about how you would reattach all loops perfectly to retain this structure after adjusting them."

All of the above",BD,temporal_reasoning," The given image shows a red dot moving very quickly towards the top-right corner. Using the concepts of motion parallax and linear perspective, we can deduce that as the distance between our eyeballs and the red dot increases, which results in a decrease in momentum or speed, the dot appears to be smaller due to parallax. The distance we see the image from is smaller. For example at a close distance, we would perceive the motion as faster as there is a larger perspective, visually smaller because the distance we seem to be closer. At a farther distance, the perspective would seem larger, and thus we perceive the motion as slower. This illustrates the distance/perception equivalence and our distance interpretation does not change our perception of speed at the object due to linear motion and the concept of motion parallax."

Please select the option the best describe the trajectory",A,physical_reasoning," The image shows two curved paths labeled with 'A' and 'B' of a physical system under a central force felic rule, but the caption mentions only 'Central Force Motion' with horizontal 'F'. The system is is under the action of a central force acting along the horizontal line F which is the radius of the path. The center of the circular motion is the intersection of FN and H.


Given the definition of central force motion in physics, the path of the point particle appears and disappears at the center, traced out by grace of the counter-clock winter. For all points in the circular path A shown, the 'F' must attract it in the same direction; B, however, for points in the counterclockwise direction 'B' must repel it, applying its centripetal acceleration - usually a simple centrifugal force suggests to accelerate simply in one direction as the path is complete under linearly continuous acceleration.


Problem statement: If the A's time is proportional to sin²function of θ and B's is proportional to cos² function of θ. Inflection points convert to crescents gradually w/o reflection.


An adequate definition of the two globs or circles shows only two desires: but how are they different from each other? A different path for both should illustrate?

How many times was green rolled in total? Answer with a single integer.",0,spatial_reasoning," The answer provided to how many times the green needs to be rolled to equal a single integer or a series of integers, given that many times was rolled in total before, is 8. When rolling a single die, you get a higher or lower result, but eight times, you can get ""3 3 2 2 2 5"", which is equal to the sum of two integers ""3 + 5"". To get eight times a single integer, you can roll 8 single integers starting from a range of ""1 to 8"" and add them up. The pattern ""8 = 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5"" breaks down to eight sequences starting from 1 ending at different numbers. To ensure each number can roll only once, roll a new sequence every time the range starts a new sequence of integers. So the pattern is ""1 1 3 6 1 7 1 4 9 6 6 9 3"" along each side. To match the dice sequences, the sequence becomes ""1 3 4 5 3 2 6"" ending at the number eight. So, in order to roll an 8th full set of numbers, you can roll the numbers just past the end of the pattern -""3 4 6 3 9 2"" on each side as well. The method for making sure only each number rolls once would be to roll a single single number each time through each combination and subtract it."

Please select the option the best describe the trajectory",C,physical_reasoning," The image displays examples of paths or trajectories, each labeled with a number and a letter (A, B, C, and D), suggesting they correspond to different orbits or trajectories in a dynamical system. For each orbit, it is asked to identify and explain which one is physically meaningful in the context of a given problem or the universe.


The problem given is a standard Central Force problem, which assumes the two particles are on a circular orbit under a 5x3 gravitational force, approaching with opposite signs of multiplied by each other's masses, and both have the same kinetic energy at infinity.


To determine which orbit is which, we must account for the kinetic energy $T_i$ being the same for all three:
\[ \frac{T_i}{\mu} = \frac{mv^2}{2} = \left(\mu + \mu\frac{3}{2|m_i||m_j|}\left(\frac{rv}{2}\right)^2 \equiv P = \frac{Pk}{2|m_i|} \]²

For a minimum energy path, \( v = 2|{k| | \sqrt{m_i|}*/μ} \):
\[ 2|{k| | \sqrt{m_i|}*/μ| = \frac{ku}{μ}(1 - \sqrt{1-2}) \equiv ku = ku = k(1-2u) = k · √{2mu}| \ = 2|k|u = k|√{2μ} \]T


For A orbit, \( u_A = kA (1-2u_A) \equiv (kA - 2u_A) = \sqrt{2kA√2μ} \)
\[therefore u_A = | \mu | \cdot \sqrt{2μ(d^2/(4kA(v_A))|度？\]
—— using KA/μA/π instead of 1.

This means \( u_B = 2 \sqrt{kB \mu/ \sqrt{π Mu} = v_B^2/(2\sqrt{Bπ}) \)

— v_B*μ/π (see Vesc. or $(1+π/π)\sqrt{mπB}`) → v_B = π√(κ√(mB∫0mB−mA)d) = π√(mBtopicπ)\\
— v_B = v_A \pm π√(mB∫0mAhaA) at closest approach, when dA = dA.

B eventuall;y, \(v_A \pm dA/(π) \\ = \sqrt{2kA + πμA/√(πB)} = \sqrt{2kA - ππdA/\sqrt{B) + √μA} über| \ √{2μ} = \sqrt{2umAlayΜ ві × πσ^2A /πμА·πμ uniquely"

The red and blue lines likely represent differing strategies or methods of biological contraception or conception, such as the rhythm method or using barrier methods like diaphragms. The green line seems to be at a lower position, suggesting a third peak, which could represent a subsequent failure or another termination of pregnancy in the per cycle. The curve is a plot that shows pregnancy's probability over time in such a cycle, and it implies higher probability in the early stages of the cycle, then dropping off and then increasing back up, showing two distinct peaks at different stages.

Given that one diagram shows a cylinder (representing objects that are cylindrical in shape and having bodies) rotating around a horizontal and a vertical axis separated by an angle of 60 degrees, with the point of rotation labeled as (0,0), and a point P on the object (with the coordinates (0, 0) at the center of the x-axis and the x-axis to the left of the rotation in this case) and the line segment PR (perpendicular to the horizontal axis and passing through points P and the rotation axis) labeled as r, this indicates a 60-degree angle rotation in the clockwise direction along one of the vertical axes, creating a cylinder shape with 60 degrees of orientation. Another diagram shows a cylinder (throw (as illustrated with the stuffed animals which are cylindrical) in shape rotating around a vertical axis with zeroing angles passing through P and vertically centered. Additionally, these cylinders have there own four points of orientation: N is 0,0 and PR stays out of the center. This diagram shows a 90 degree rotation in the clockwise direction around the vertical axes, passing through P and centered.


In this context without any additional information, it cannot be determined what kind of ""stuffed animals"" are used as a visual representation of ""objects"" or what ""throw"" means, but these diagrams are explaining that 60 degrees and 90 degrees is the difference in the amount of rotation needed, and so pointing out where and what kind of objects you can use to represent these cylinder-shaped things, along with the axis of rotation described."

Choose the graph that best describe the displacement of the object",C,physical_reasoning," The image shows continuous waveforms with voltages graphed over time, using an ascending or time-anticipating graph, which means the waves are graphed in increasing amplitude over time. Here are the interpretations based on the horizontal axis labeled A, B, and C:


1. A represents the peaks and troughs in the graphs labeled A-A', B', and C''. Each of these wavesform peaks of roughly 0.0V at a certain time, has an increase in amplitude over time (indicated as A' = 3*PCs), and then goes to 2.0V before relapsing and peaking at around 2.0V again soon after.
2. B' appears to have a more temperate rise in amplitude compared to A' but also somewhat relined and follows a parabola-like curve, indicating that its amplitude is also decreasing back and forth over time at intermediate points, although this one is described as having a 2.0V increase and being v greater than PCs.
3. C' suggests rapid increases passing through zero voltage with a downturn to 2.0V - this descends very quickly before ascending back to 2.0V over a short period and doing so in rapid sequence.
4. Color, Red and Blue are presumably meant to represent the same graph but from different times, and this could be the thermal and the electronic viewpoint respectively, suggesting 2.0V increase, followed by a sharp drop to -0V and resuming at 2.0V while holding this steady over a period slightly longer than the 2.0V decrease and back rise held at most steady only.
5. Finally, Dimon statements are likely a description of the labeled C in a different part of a process for comparison purpose, indicating proper negative low to certain positive voltage and currently loose as in an indicator of undesired sideways or open circuit.

1. Each graph appears to plot time with rapid changes in the voltage, particularly over some critical points, like peaks (A' and C'), which compare well, indicating straight and successful close.
2. The F and D statements might be referring to statistical Process Control charts as you run that type of continuously monitor production.

3. E is an example of an analytical waveform in appearance, possible -0V with a relatively slow-moving 20V spike, which could be considered untraditional.

Please answer with a just a number and nothing else ",324,mathematical_reasoning," The question in the video asks for the volume of a three-dimensional object, which is described as the cube of an element in a four-dimensional lattice. To find the volume of a cube, one needs to calculate the area inside the cube and multiply it by its height. The possible mistake is that instead of cubing it by the height, they cubed the volume. To find the volume of a cube, calculate the areas, and then multiply them by the distance from base to base which is the same for all three cases.


However, for the given LED cube in the figure, the volume formula will be calculated by finding the volume (F_cube) as the product of height (h), width (w), and length (l) as h*w*l, and the volume of the rectangle (F_rect) as the width multiplied by the distance as (remaining height) for this case. Then the VLUM which is an incorrect value would be found, giving a volume of F_cube*h_dist through F_rect*h_dist. The correct volume is the sum of the two, which is Vcube = F_cube + F_rect.


To find the correct volume, which is the sum of the two volumes, Vcube = F_cube * height_dist = 512.97*5.365 + (w*l)(5.36). Then use this to substitute into Vcube with the calculated volume for the LED cube: Vcube = 13903.11128 m^3.


The correct volume of the LED cube would be 512.97 m^3. You need to exit in the simulation to calculate the volume correctly using the Vcube if the above calculation seems to still give a wrong volume."

Here, the red line with a negative slope represents the conductance of a series circuit and the arrowhead represents the electron flow. One part of the electron flow is shown to pass through a resistor (represented by the series resistor), indicating that it is less conductive and can cause more energy loss or consume more energy. The path of electron flow also includes an organic solvent, Parala, which is probably a type of solution or liquid, leading to internal chemical reactions or the release of energy within the organic matter. Another supplement, Cyclite, is indicated by the orange slope with a positive gradient, suggesting that this could be a less common energy release channel, potentially due to internal chemical processes within the organic matter (endothermic reaction) and indicates a faster flow of energy, that exothermic reaction/electron flow could be going to another direction.

The question being answered is to describe a relationship given three different responses related to these signals. To find the correct relationship between two signals x(t) and y(t), we look at each type of signal and look for a pattern in the graph that could lead to the correct conclusion.



For the square wave, we find a direct correlation between x(t) and y(t) when the x-axis represents squares, as there is one square per cycle of the x-axis against each of the y-axis ranges. We deduce that y(t) is proportional to x(t).


For the sine wave, we observe that there seems to be a sinusoidal component in x(t) that ranges between 0 and pi/2. This leads us to assume that the sine occurs as the amplitude of x(t) rises and falls. Comparing every cycle of the x-axis to the y-axis yields a variable amplitude, which suggests that y(t) might be proportional to x(t).


From these observations, we gather that when we consider signalling and psychoacoustic responses, the signals closely match, where x(t) rises and falls sinusoidally and y(t) either remains the same orptrident to x(t)."

It seems to be representing a question or a call to action, possibly about transcending to the 5D reality, which may imply that we can navigate through a higher dimensional space or achieve a consciousness mode. The term ""5D reality"" refers to the next dimension beyond the familiar three-dimensional reality, often used in physics and cosmology to describe higher-dimensional alternate spaces where higher-level physics operations or advanced states of consciousness could exist. Interpreting this further would require additional context, as responses can if the dot and triangle are colors are connected in any way (for example, if they symbolize an experience related to 5D coordinates), or if the video features specific symbols or words related to the concept of transcending to 5D reality, usability of the message, or it could simply be a representation of something else related to mathematics or abstract concepts.

Please answer with a just a number and nothing else ",139,mathematical_reasoning," The problem describes the summation of the row when describing the cell at each position in the row. Let's count the second row from the top as shown in the main image. To confirm, the second row contains items at positions 2, 3, and 4 (sum = 112), and counting the blank cell also, there are no unique cells in row 2. Therefore, the next row (row 3) to be counted will contain the cell at position 5 and 6, resulting in a sum of 13 (1+2+3+6=113). The pattern suggests that after a set of unique cells in a row, there is a blank cell (16), followed by another set of three unique cells (1+7+8+9=18). This pattern continues to the right and not repeating any sets of 3. Since each row has no unique cell repeated at any position, the sum can be 10 + 10 + 10 + 10=320. Summing up all the numbers in the third row will give us the answer."

However, there are also images of a different visual style on the side that talk about n*squareGeo/m*Identify/ObjStudy/padMS+Identify, which are likely a commentary on an instruction or in-game item. 48140 and 4815 might be references to game elements, such as Pokéballs or abilities. The images are not spelled out and could be from a video game or app that teaches you how to identify or study Pokémon items. They are related to ""Nastro"", which could be a method/strategy/system like in Pokémon, saying ""n"" could stand for Nastro, implying it's the method's name.

The pictures on the left appear to relate to ""Scissors/Dispair"" and ""Disturb/Disturb + Trio"" which might imply strategies or situations you can encounter in the game that involve Scissors or other elements mentioned (Trio could be a bit deceitful).


Officially observing an element after realizing you might encounter Disturb (Disturb+Disturb). .....could be another instruction.


The sequence looks like it's guiding you to spend attention to these various steps or methods that can help you progress, and by the time the sequence is complete, it's about to tell you what you should be paying attention to or your next task, possibly related to nastro* or nmask.


The bottom right image seems to be an end-of-tutorial or a completion clue, like ""know you won or gg, was gg/prep for final stage"". It could be the template or outcome of the game being drawn to a close. gg/prep might imply ""Good game, well-prepared for the final stage"".

Overall, it seems like there's some kind of guide or methodology for leveling up in-game currency or understanding specific in-game elements emphasizing quality and out-manning opponents, or stages, possibly implying to outsmart opponents' strategies and for a better gaming experience."

Then, to convert this combined pyramid into a cube or a pyramid, they are to be twisted, as shown: ""pyramid1 - cube1, pyramid2 - cube1, pyramid2 - cube1, pyramid3 - cube1, pyramid4 - cube1."" This moves the cube out, leaving the pyramid in its original shape. The final step is to twist the pyramid again in the opposite direction to return the cube or pyramid to its original form and return a pyramid."

Here's the translation onto the board: P(x) = ∫ [dx]

([/dx] term is generalized for the particle in the state where the value of each Dobrovnia path is 0 times the cosQuantum factor and the rest is just dt]


- ∫[dt]/[dt] is equivalent to the negative square root of the [Tᵢ]−1/2. (This proves [Tᵢ]−1/2 decays to dt^−1 allowing you to integrate over a single time slice in order)

- Maximum ∫[Tᵢ / [Tᵢ − 1/2] over the paths P(x) = ∫ [dt] [dx] begins integrating smoothly over the path of a function dt.

To find exponentials of dt−1 and dt these need to divide by \(\sqrt{m}\), integrands should also multiply over square roots of \(\sqrt{T}\_issues])= \( dt^-\sqrt{m+1\}\), and thus each integral transforms to: v(x) * exp[-1/2T(x)/\sqrt{T(x)m} + 1} dx"

- Where is it starting from (+x and +y) = (0,0)? We need to determine the intersection of the lines \( y = xhat_4\) and \( xhat_1 - 4x + 4y = 0\). Here, \( h_0 = 4x + 4y = 0\) passes thru the origin.
- Kangaroo \( S\) passes thru the origin.
- From (0,0) to \( 9.75x+0.75y = 0\) via \( S\), \( \frac{d}{dx}S = -xhat_4\) and \( \frac{d}{dy}S = -4xhat_1+4y\).
- Finally, from the point (0, 9.75) to (0) via \( T\) \( \frac{d}{dx}T = 0\).
- The midpoint of \( S\) to \( T\) is the line where \( \frac{d}{dx}T = -xhat_4\).

- From (0,0) to \( 9.75\) via \( T\), \( \frac{d}{dx}T = -xhat_4+4x\).

- \( S\) has first coordinate \( h_0 - 4\) and second \( \frac{d}{dx}S = 4x\) so we intersect it with \( x = h_0-4\).

- \( T\) has second coordinate \( \frac{d}{dx}T\) which solves \( x=h_0+4\).

- From \( (0,9.75x+7.5y) = 0\) to \( (0,9.75x+4y) = 0\) from \( S\) to \( T\), both routes intersect \( h_0 - 4x + 4y\) and \( 9.75x+4y\) at \( (-4, 4)\).
- One leg of \( S\) doesn't intersect \( h_0 - 4x + 4y\) at \( 0\) but does intersect it at \( (-9.75, 7.5\).
- One leg of \( T\) intersects \( 9.75x + 4y\) at \((0, 9.7.5y)\) and \(h_0-4y\) at \(0\) and doesn't intersect \(9.75x-4x\).
- The other leg of \( S\) intersects \( h_0-4x + 4y\) at \(0\) and \( (-9.75, 7.5)\) and \(h_0 + 4y\) at \(4\) and \(9.75y\) but not in that leg of \(T\).

- \( T\) passes \( 9.75x+4y\) at the origin and intersects \(h_0-4x - 4y\) and \(h_0+4y\) at \(-\frac{1}{25y}\) on the outside of \( S\).
- All four coordinates give for \(T\) are the same coordinates, so \(T\) sips thru \(h_0+4x + 4y\).
- \( S\) has it's first point \(S_1\) at \((\frac{1}{5y}, -\frac{16}{5}\), \frac{d}{dx}S_1 = -\frac{d}{dx}T\) and \( \frac{d}{dy}S_1 = -4xhat_1+4y\).
- \( S\) doesn't intersect \(h_0\) at \(0\) and intersects \(9.75x+4y\) and \( h_0=-4x\) at \(-\frac{1}{2y}\), but is +4y"".
- From \(S_1\) moving to \(h_0+4x+4y\), the line where \( \frac{d}{dx} = -\frac{d}{dx}T+4xhat_4+4x\) and \( \frac{d}{dy} = \frac{d}{dy}T-4xhat_1-4y+4y\) intersects \(h_0-4x\) at \(-\frac{6}{5y}\).
- All three groups have intersection \(x=0\). \( T\) must remove batch points from \(S\) and \(S_1\) to intersect \(h_0\)."

2. Detection: Finding outliers based on these features. Outliers are probably the most consistent data points from encoded modalities.
3. Classify: Based on the extracted features and their identified outliers, categorizing the data as close or far from typicality.
4. Low dimensionality feature extraction: Squeezing the information into a lower-dimensional space.
5. Decision: Choosing a reasonable and justifiable feature space from the much higher-dimensional data.

6. Detection: Finding a close or far classification.

2. A ""integrated"" energy (E\_I') in a state of mutual energy, the second vertical dashed line from the left, which implies energy exchange where a ""cylinder x"" is moving upward from the ""rotating reference frame"" to the ""pristine"" energy state.
3. An ""interior"" energy (E\_I) at 45% of its energy retained in a shape equal to a ""cylinder y"" on the right-hand side.
4. ""Partial"" energy (E) at less than 5%, which is the total displacement of the cylinder y over the cylinder x. It's implied that when cylinder y occupies 1% of x, it retains 1% of its energy.
5. An energy (E) in a state of 95%, occupied by the cylinder y, which implies an efficiency indicated by the 95% of the cylinder x motion within the cylinder y.

6. Energy (E) of the cylinder x is also 95%, with a total displacement of 11%.


Each energy system's starting energy value is 1000% (E_1), with a reduction to 10% due to the motion of the overtaking cylinder (E_I'), and total remaining energy in the decreasing proportion to the number of cylinders (E_I'/2); however, the final energy reduces to 10% (E_0).

334,abstract_reasoning_logical_reasoning_arcagi2_combined_b10624e5_count.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,How many green squares should appear in the output grid? Answer with a single integer,30,abstract_reasoning," In the image you provided, there is a four-block puzzle with two sets of two blocks each. To solve this puzzle, one must know that, when removing a block from a four-by-four square, the result should leave a four-by-four pattern. If the block is removed from the bottom right, it will create a three-by-three pattern. Observe that the two blocks have dots within the sprites. If the bottom dot of the block with the fattest part below (from the top) is not aligned vertically with the bottom midpoint, it is actually vertical, which would create a four-by-two pattern if it changed direction.


At the bottom, the block on the right has to remain (since it is already aligned), and it has horizontal dots, meaning it must start a four-by-two— horizontal square in the end. This is because the row of blocks in the top-left corner sits in the same way, and since alignment of blocks should not change, becomes two, then they are vertical and then maintains horizontal because of two.


The block with the two dots suggests, though, that it has to stay because there were two dots on the edge elsewise. The top block's dots do not move.

Hence, the top block must have to be pointy, practically flat, and on the vertical axis while still aligned with top midpoint, then that goes in three-by-three. The block below and including the fattest middle part of this top rectangle, where two dots meet from above, is vertical, not aligned with bottom, has to be on the top to finish the end, which is already a two-by-two – we must choose top blocks to hold vertical blocks given.


The puzzle, when solved, will have two blocks on the vertical axis at the top and two on the bottom, with the block with two dots pointing downwards, two dots pointing upwards, one horizontal and bottom two horizontal. The one with only a single horizontal dot is pointing to the right but upward, while the block with a single vertical dot and no midpoint between these two blocks means it is starting in the three-by-three and points to the right."

The leftmost and rightmost rows each contain three scales in shades of red and blue. Each row consists of three scales are lined up one on top of the other with a new color in the middle. For example, the row on the left has red at the top, red in the middle, and blue at the bottom. Each scale represents a different unit or quantity, possibly different quantities of items like laps, points, or progressive tones.


In the middle of the image, there is a ""Transpose"" block. The block diagrams below indicate how these different color-coded scales can be transposed. This transposed application implies that by rotating these rows, the colors will reverse, as shown in the throw-back method which continued from left to right. Starting from the pattern of middle Throwback rows, once the height is reached for the orange color (third row), then the rows will from right to left change colors as indicated. Remember the middle row that has orange, red, and blue. When the row with orange moves to the top, it will then follow the pattern clockwise from the second row that has a lighter shade of orange.


Each row in the new sequence from right to left includes the row's original color now at the top, its transposed middle, and the one that gave the previous row from the righthand side, which should be a lighter shade. If the original light orange row transposes to the top, then the row containing the darker orange will transpose to the middle, and the one containing the darker purple will move to the top row. The logic extends to all five rows as started during the transposing. The counter, which is shown in the illustration, provides a single digit based on this transposition to help remember the sequence.


In summary, the system allows for a way to transition from one configuration to the next and keeps track of the transposed sequence numerically by color. Each layer rotates and numbers its levels as it moves through the process, effectively reversing the color sequence from bottom to top, indicating movement beyond the original starting position."

The key is the conscious distribution of the two-half-and-one bend, arranging them at a specific angle and having a specific number of crossings that match the entanglement that the three-half-and-two bends form and the bend they are in, which in this case is four-and-three bend. It is an arrangement that demonstrates how to recognize and avoid these two knots when attempting to tie them."

D. 2
E. 3",C,spatial_reasoning," The video describes a vision task where a subject is shown a task involving a ball on a conveyor belt that moves along a circular path. There are eight distinct steps in the scrolling of the conveyor belt, and the task is for the subject to determine if the ball is moving clockwise or counterclockwise accurately with each step. Using the information provided and the path of the conveyor belt, we can calculate the ball's direction of motion at each step.


At step 1, the ball is on the conveyor belt and is closer to the start than the end. Moving clockwise from our perspective. Thus, the ball's direction of motion remains the same (clockwise). The conveyor belt turns, moving from right to left, taking the ball at a faster speed.

At step 2, the ball is closer to the end of the conveyor belt now and still moving counterclockwise. So, the ball starts moving in the counter-clockwise direction.
At step 3, the ball is now closer to the midpoint, and we are seeing it from a stationary perspective. In this case, we can deduce that the ball's motion remains constant from midpoint and works in both directions.
At step 4, the ball is closer to the start of the conveyor belt, and also halfway in duration from the start. Again, we have a constant motion from our perspective.
At step 5, the ball is close to the end again and halfway in duration from the start. Once again, we see no real change in motion, so the ball remains constant in motion.
At step 6, the ball is near the end of the conveyor belt again. The conveyor belt turns counterclockwise, and as a result, the ball moves in the same direction, still moving counterclockwise.
At step 7, the ball starts moving from the center midpoint, and we no longer get a consistent clockwise direction, as it's closer to the start. This reverses the trajectory as non-clockwise. But the conveyor belt keeps moving in the counterclockwise direction, so the ball starts retuning in the clockwise direction.
Finally, at step 8, the ball is near the start of the conveyor belt, and moving clockwise, similar to the original trajectory at the beginning.


The key point here is that the ball's direction changes from step 4 and up, regardless of its position on the conveyor belt due to changing centers of rotation, but the conveyor belt motion persists in the same direction. Despite this change, the ball still travels consistently in counter-clockwise motion."

Please return a single number (e.g. 3). Nothing preceding or following it.",4,planning_reasoning," The description in the video suggests a visual representation of a number N accompanied by a creature made out of the letter balloons. The creature appears to be blue and is surrounded by snow. Each option represents a different title related to the image. To determine which title corresponds to the image, we need to analyze the character's appearance to identify it. The creature in the image has several elements: a smooth blue surface resembling ice or snow (indicating coldness), the number 5 next to it (possibly denoting some kind of comparative measurement or level), and the use of balloons instead of text labels (the character itself).


The titles provided are:
- ""heroic""
- ""jungle""
- ""riveting""
- ""charming""

- ""wise""
- ""mysterious""
- ""swaying""


Based on these options, it seems that the comparison is likely to snow ""heroic kids"", as denoted by the number ""5"", which implies it is strong or significant. ""Heroic"" indicates a strong feeling of being a hero, so it's likely comparing this creature to something impressive or significant, making sense with the character's visual resemblance to ice or snow.


Therefore, based on the visual cues, the correct title would be ""heroic"", which is followed by a mention of ""charming"" with a blue superhero, further defining the character as effective but also alluring or engaging."

346,abstract_reasoning_logical_reasoning_arcagi2_combined_7b80bb43_mc.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,Which output grid should follow? Answer with one multiple choice option.,e,abstract_reasoning," To see the pattern, focus on the color blocks. The pattern in the image is such that each question is a moving tiles process within the rows, advancing by one row after each pawn on down alert, with no change in color. However, the number of question moves left does not change as the number of alerts moves within the rows does.

Now mapping the pattern to the second group of colored tiles, we see how it moves:

This video shows that question pairs progress down the rows but do not change in color. Now, look at the alert tiles:

By observing the alert tiles' movement:
- First fully colored square on the right: Goes down then back to empty squares
- Second fully colored tile on the right: Goes down then stays empty (no change in color)
- Third frosted tile on the right: Goes down, then stays empty after becoming twinned (no change in color)
To next square from right, it goes down then stays empty (no change in color)
Next square, the first frosted on the right: Goes down then stays empty (no change in color)
Next frosted square, the first tiles (now it looks like two overlapping boxes) go down, then a new empty (which becomes empty after 'alert to' square)
Next turn, the frosted moves down, but technically empty (3rd, 4th col new box, accompanied by uncolored fully colored eighth square from the right now in the row)
Next dark colored box: Left, goes down then stays empty (no change in color)
Next, the first frosted on the left of the confrontation box looking group goes down then stays empty (no change in color)
Next, the alternate-colored square goes down and then stays empty (no change in color)
This pattern is akin to the alert generation going down, complete row, then no change in color with a well to the next alert type, then repeating the first square. The pattern evidences a shift in the evacuation column and sets up a memory of adjacent blocks and the alert generation's one is the door key factor. The group on the right most alternates between uncolored and colored. It needed a sliding sequence of alerts to evacuate this structure change."

(A move is defined as going one step in any valid direction: up, down, left, or right, without crossing walls.)
Please return a single number (e.g. 3). Nothing preceding or following it.",50,planning_reasoning," To solve the maze in the attached image, you must determine which word corresponds to the number ""2"" and where it is positioned on the maze board by following the dotted lines leading to it. Since the letters are not in a 1-to-5 grid system and instead appear in different positions, you will need to figure out which number the word represents based on the maze-solving pattern from the past instances provided. Typically, the number ""2"" would correspond to letters or words near the first vertical line of the 5 horizontal lines at the center of the board. However, this pattern also suggests starting from the bottom half of the board which you would mark for the bottom letter.


If you mark the bottom letter, the pattern indicates starting to the first vertical line of the first word from the left, and then continue across four instances more down starting from the first horizontal edge of the bottom to the left, and then to the second word before the first instance from the left, but marked with the second vertical line of the bottom. This suggests starting from the fourth horizontal line from the bottom. Following this pattern, you can reach the correct letters ""2"" based on the maze design, which is shown by the ""MAZE"" written in the correct position in the image diagonally from the top right to the bottom right.



The correct letters for ""2"" would be ""IN M EPA T"". This is positioned on the second horizontal line from the left, and the pattern is from bottom left to right. So to get there, starting from the second horizontal line from the bottom, which is on the left and identifying the third word from the top, then finally reaching to the letter ""O"", it is at the third instance on the bottom horizontal edge where ""IN"" is at the second position, then on to the next line where ""E"" is at the third position down, and finally ""PA"" on the last instance in the bottom down to the left."

The partially obscured text reads ""plies to"" followed by a word that is very difficult to make out due to the blurriness of the image. However, it appears that the number ""96"" is visible in that section, right by the ""6"" and could be part of the word following ""playtime"". The text surrounding this number indicates that it is not an error as it also says ""Each multiple choice"" followed by a series of three numbers ""12494"" that are clear to the viewer. The context suggests it's a reference to a score of some kind, possibly in an educational test. A provision in the text which would normally be a terminating phrase implies that it's not a part of the score because it says ""each multiple choice"" followed by ""1294"". The number ""96"" appears to be a part of a word due to its indentation, albeit in a very scribbled manner, and is just adjacent to ""plies to"" which could be part of another word. The numbers could have a specific meaning if they were part of a ranking, table, or it could represent some data structure where ""96"" is the number of weeks in some sort of repeat iteration, followed by ""the"" and then ""to end amount""."
359,temporal_reasoning_process_understanding_object_manipulation_domino2.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,How many dominoes were green?,8,temporal_reasoning," The question in the video is about how to calculate the area of four colored diagrams and the edges are in meters. First, it asks for the measurement of the base widths. The diagrams need to be converted into centimeters, which is unrelated to the edge measurement since the edge measurement is already given in meters. Then the areas of the yellow, red, and green figures are given separately, and it's assumed that the area of the blue area is approximately the same number as the yellow area.


The color blend of the different combinations of figures may vary from green at the top to yellow at the bottom. The dimensions are shown in meters when illustrating the yellow figures. If you I enter them using centimeters instead, assuming all areas remain the same, I would need to be cautious because the dimensions are different because of the color blend differences. However, using the given assumptions that the areas will be around the same, in centimeters they would be approximately the yellow areas. If the diagrams were done using meters without color variability, then the figure areas would not be all the same. If any adjustments become necessary, they will be due to the blending where colors would be similar incentimeters."

To securely form this knot, you would first have to start with the bottom X's before lifting ropes from the sides and converting the X's on your first knot into tucks, then starting with tucks, and with your second knot, you'd have to tuck them to the opposite side of the previous tail. Once you reach the end of the bottom knot, you'd tuck it in place with another tuck, forming a square knot. Along with the tucks, you'd form a small mountain of columns. Finally, as the top X's dropped down past the first knot, you'd lift them with your second knot and tuck in the same place, completing the square knot. The result is a figure-eight knot that isn't just tied once but once pierced and passed over from the ends like a seal, no new tail yet."

This relationship is found using inverse square root of the speed and distance with respect to the source. The specific values of speed and distance from the image are not given, and thus, the units of ""c"" could be in ""m/s"" and ""d"" could be in ""km"" and ""ms"", but we can see that as the source moves over time, the distance increases at a rate proportional to the light speed. This indicates that the sources are moving together, pointing to the conclusion that ""c"" and ""x"" could be the same speed and distance units since the functions are inverses of each other, meaning the inverse of ""c"" equals the source ""x""."
370,abstract_reasoning_logical_reasoning_arcagi2_combined_dbff022c_count.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,How many dark red squares should appear in the output grid? Answer with a single integer,4,abstract_reasoning," The question in the video requires you to remember the following: a red square, a turquoise square, a pink square, a light blue square, and a dark blue square. In one example, the two dark blue squares are grouped together as is done with the pink and the turquoise, while the two light blue squares are grouped together as is done with the red and the pink square. The puzzle then asks which two pairs did you factor in making the arrangement of other two blocks and different pairs are now grouped together. To answer this puzzle, you would think of the groupings from the directions shown in the previous picture where the pink and turquoise squares are grouped together as if they were equipment. The dark blue squares are the remaining equipment. In this arrangement, the puzzle suggests that the light blue and the red are grouped together and no pair has changed to meet the required criteria. This means that the answer is the two dark blue squares placed in the corner of the light, which are not animated or grouped together in the puzzle."

The Left and Right sides have four blocks each. This information does not allow for firm conclusions on the overall shape or the number of blocks, but it can be observed that each side of the two sides has an equal length. Since the blocks do not interlock, individual shapes cannot be caused by rotation. Some block geodesics might interlock like the one that makes a box and two that look like a ""T"" but the other shapes only partially interlock. Additionally, all block geodesics might partially interlock with some block shapes may always look like ""Z"" in form. Any other requirements of the blocks would be unremarkable aside from 'A' and 'B' are at bottom corners of some block shapes. We can deduce that the blocks are all identical in shape, likely 3D with short poles and a four-sided agnostic loop.

Your answer should only be a number (e.g. 1).",6,planning_reasoning," The diagram provided shows a potential way to tie a knot, using a rope or a similar encased line. The knot is formed by interlocking the strands of the line and creating a loop, which is then passed through this loop twice to create a four-strand knot. This layout is characteristic of a specific thick knot, and it's likely meant to demonstrate the tying of the knot with precision. It is akin to a ""choke"" knot or a ""Hitch"" knot, where the end of the strand, depending on the helix, passes through the loop in the opposite direction of the rest of the line. The rest of the strands are tightened around the loop based on their direction, making it secure and easy to untie by loosening them from the center first, followed by rotating the loop and unwinding according to the directions on the sides. This is useful in nautical or maritime activities where double or triple lines may need to be securely arranged, such as tying large zoo rings or in anchors."

* As we've reduced the arc by one quarter, the diameter of the two exposures of the segments inside this circle divided by the number of quarters reduces the segment size. In this case, 4 quarters.
2. Now Top Half divided by standard segments: 
* The top half of a standard quarter is two quarters, as it remains the same quarter.
* Two next-standard quarters as the gap between the two sub-quarter parts.

* The space of a standard square is formed by one of these two segments and the fourth quarter type, balancing the full circle.

3. Now, a right-angled trapezoid is formed with the top half and top edge, divided by the gap between the two segments.
* The height of this trapezoid is half the height of the top edge, which is a quarter.
* Some distance is added to this trapezoid due to the length of the gap between two segments, which would double the top length.
4. The whole side of the rectangle filled in by the quarter and double the height, containing two quarters is the measure of this trapezoid.

5. Now, double this rectangle by the size, which is square, thus, half times its height.
5. Once you've doubled the rectangle, it covers the gap between the two quarters that rises into a section.
6. Double the height of the trapezoid and square.
7. Straighten the rectangle inside to ensure a radius on both the inner edge.
8. The most inner outer edge in the circle, divided into 2 quarters, begins at the quarter mark to cut this straight corner.

9. A segment of half the arc is now added inside for the segment from the gap between quarters in the circle.
10. Now, take this gap part of the arc inside the circle and apply it to this rectangle. This is a quarter placed vertically.
111. Take the diagonal of the square to the size of a quarter of the rectangle.
12. It is half the diagonal of the square inside, effectively covering the space of a quarter but taking from it.
13. The quarter returns to the quarter inside the square in height.
14. So, take the distance of this quarter to create a new height.


Now, let's represent the circle with its segments and quarters on a new diagram:
1. Complete rings are formed by the arcs from quarters with standard radius.
2. A gap of a tomato is within the ring.
3. A certain number of segments or quarters are visible along the circle, we can determine.
4. Currently, the gap and four quarters are equal.
5. If we were to fix it, there would be 1 quarter at one starting point. So, it means the rest would be inside a perfect square.

6. The circles fit within the square, adding nodes, and the segments created by the gap multiply.
7. There is a proportional segment in the left and in the bottom half of equal radius, and arcs that become a quadrant of 1/2 responsibility to separate the environment from the gap and more, which is the squared circle.

8. This is the geometric progression of the square.


Let's summarize the steps by a unique narrative:


Starting with a gap, a single ring is shown by the quarters, with a small angle. The ring is split straight in four quarters. The quarters seem to touch a mostly geometrical square that's shown and split in half, and now a film tape is visible.


When there is half a ring with an arc, the square gets split in more and less gaps as two. Overlapping circles with arcs split in two sections and an opposing radius from the quarter generated, show geometric squares building up with 1/2. Eventually, a full circle that was just placed under the gap using the squares is pieced together, along with its top and bottom.


Now, the full circle's quarter part is separated, but we need a new gap and put it back on the rings. Above the gap, the message ""image 2"" is mentioned, but it is the thing we've seen, and the bottom is split, just like image 1, while a gap is positioned to get all quarters into a square on its sides while cutting through one half into two parts. Then, we separate one quarter to create both the gap and one side in halves.


For the final circle fit, we draw exactly two quarters, balance it in the arc's position. A proportion of the new gap is shown as a quarter segment on the rectangle to regain the square from it using the corners. This time, it's just showing two quarters, and with that knowledge, a new gap is found in the trapezoid, sending one corner to ensure using both a half of the rectangle and subtracted. We unite the two halves in the new gap created, balancing the top side. Just before the last circle, top halves are outlined on the trapezoid. The two sides fit, and square is shown full, with top halves, then the gaps needed to be squared, getting a trapezoid, and the rectangle from it.


To summarize, the circle is made of a full set of quarters and an arc proudly sliced gaps, forming a divine rectangle that's regained, which, along with slightly longer height, forms a perfect square. The square is then trapezoidal, and the mode is ended, with a rectangle, the large circle, by cutting in half and keeping one side at a corner."

406,abstract_reasoning_logical_reasoning_arcagi2_combined_abc82100_mc.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,Which output grid should follow? Answer with one multiple choice option.,b,abstract_reasoning," Since this is an image of a Rubik's Cube, the main objective is to match the color of each face of the cube to the respective solid color. Here's the solution for the Rubik's Cube shown in the image:


1. The bottoms right face is orange.
2. The faces adjacent to the bottom right face should be yellow since they are completing the band.
3. The top left face should have a solid color that matches the other adjacent face value.
4. The top right face should have a solid color that completes another band opposite to the previous two.
5. The left face with each row is different, best guess is red and blue.
6. The right face is the same random non-band color.


Given that the steps 2, 3, and 5 may be in a single direction, and not at a right angle, a possible band solution could be:

- Step 2: Yellow (Bottom right face to top right face (red)
- Step 3: Adjacent face (The band could either be orange from the top or blue from the bottom, but it only has one component that matches the two faces above it consistently, which is blue)
- Step 5: Adjacent face (Adjacent to green side)


For the remaining face, red would be the most likely guess following the pattern of Step 3 as above, but note:
- Step 2: Orange (already matched)
- Step 3: Bottom left face (possible matching color is red or blue outside the band, but the component that matches the other three upper faces will be both orange and red in one possible direction and blue in another outside the band)
- Step 5: Adjacent to the non-band solid color


Given the second and third steps, the possible choices for the non-band solid color could be:
- Possible directions: red (matching two upper faces) or blue (matching two upper faces)


Each face has two choices that are most likely to match two in a row; they alternate red and blue.
Considering this, the restoration of the cube after a step 3 would be in a consistent direction with the previous two. In this case, the most likely first step to perform would be Step 2. Then it would alternate between red and blue. Finally, a match for the Step 3 would give a white face, and if the band is not one of those two, the matching face/color will either be blue and the band will be red or vice versa. The Bottom left placement rule would not be relevant in this case, but it's a possibility for a separate attempt. Therefore, the current guess based on the given information would be:

- Step 3: Yellow
- Step 4: Adjacent to an unmatched face (Adjacent to each pair from Step 3 and alternating between red and blue)
- Step 5: Adjacent to unmatched face (Adjacent to each pair from yellow and alternating between red and blue)


Following this, the cube would be oriented in a mixed state, and for the Step 2 the unmatched face would be orange and for the Step 5, the unmatched face would be a solid color that matches either red or blue consistently. To determine the rest of the sequence, consider the method of alternating two directions and the two possible 'reds' in Step 3, which goes either with the red from Step 1 or the blue from Step 5. The alternatives are:
- The red from Step 1 (least likely since the cube is not in an oriented state)

- The red from Step 5 (more likely after a successful Step 3: Yellow and Step 4 sequence)


To avoid unmatched pairs before Step 6 which are less common, such as beginnings of bands when the cube could be solved, let's first solidify the bands that will be consistent for Step 6:
- The bold path follows a sequence, the band could be one of orange, yellow, and top row - and then the random field from Steps 3, 4, and 5 could be any color as the point where to start the final matching."

Someone plucks the string at x = 7.7 m. How high does the fly have to jump to avoid getting hit by the wave? Output just the correct letter:,D,mathematical_reasoning," The problem shows a graph with two lines on it, which are labeled f(x) and g(x). The equation of line f(x) is y = 1.6. The task is to justify the function g(x) by finding detail that must be modified to make the function correct. Let's walk through the details.


On the x-axis, there is a scale from 0-10.5 where g(x) is close to the x-axis, so the graph must be of the function that's near the y=0 and not of 1.6. Function g(x) must be modified for the x values of 0-0.10 to have a slope of about 1, but for the y-axis where y=1 (only on g(x) values) it must have that slope. This means we are multiplying g(x) by 1.5.


Since y=1 means f(x) has a y-intercept of 1, and the slope is 1.6, g(x) must have a y-intercept of about 1 and a slope of 1.6 (if it weren't for the x=0), that is, the slope would be 16, since 6 units of a change in x and looks 6 units of the graph. Now, you need to find how much x=1 changes within 0-0.1.

Thus, between x=0 and x=0.1, we divide g(x) = y/1.5. This gives g(x) = 1. So we can see that g(x) is directly proportional to y with a slope of 1.


However, the problem still states to multiply f(x) by 1.6 in x=1. This means f(x) goes up by 6 when x=1.6, but f(x) also changes by the same slope when x=1, i.e., 6 units of x change by relatively very much. Thus, the slope of g(x) at x=1 must also be 6.
Now, we have an inconsistency. So, the slope of g(x) should be 6 at x=1 but that means f(x) should have a much larger slope at x=1 than the slope of g(x). We cannot do something with f(x) as g(x) multiplied by its slope without affecting its y-intercept, so instead, we must realize that g(x) should have a slope of 1 at x=1.6 so that f(x) must be multiplied by 1.6 at x=1.6 rather than x=1. This will result in f(x) not just increasing by 6 units, but changing disproportionately with x. The slope of g(x) at x=1 will remain undisturbed. Now, everything works out."

Please answer with just the letter of the group and nothing else ,Y,mathematical_reasoning," In the video, we see an animal lifting or being lifted off the ground. Below the animal, we see some colored lines. These colored lines likely represent the description of whoever or whatever it is seen. The darker of the colored lines gradually increases towards the bottom right, indicating that as the lift goes up, the line does as well. This could be interpreted as a visual representation of progress in a certain context, possibly related to the amount of lift, height gain, upward momentum, or conceptual growth. In the context of biological growth or productivity, the darkest line could represent DNA replication, RNA transcription, or protein synthesis, which are critical processes in cell growth. Adjacent to this, we see a solid object with the same angle, which might represent something orthogonal to the lift. It appears to be mentioned in this span of time.


- The darker line falls gradually, which could symbolize various biological or educational progresses over time, as the height of the end-points.
- The darker line indicating faster or greater has long most digits of leftward motion.
- Solid growth concepts adjacent to the gradient could imply various internal operations, like the development, product practice, study, or organizational growth.
Consider combining the animal image as insights, the pattern and object beneath it would represent the founding, creating, or evolution.

- Biological growth on the darker line progressing to medium could signify genetic mutation, DNA replication, development, or tissue cell renewal.

Output the answer rounded to 2 decimal places.,23.41,mathematical_reasoning," The expression \( f(x) = (1 - x) \sqrt{-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) \) represents a complex number, as denoted by \( z = x + iy i \), where \( y \) is a real quantity. This can be translated to the complex plane in the form \( z = r + iy i \) since \( x \in (-\infty,-1)\cup\{-1/2\}\cup1/2 \cup 1 \cup\infty \) cannot be the square root of \( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\). However, there are two separate cases based on the value of \( y \):


1. \( y \equiv 0 \): \( x = 1\) and \( y \) becomes an important part of the complex number \( 1+0i \equiv 1+0i \). This is the final answer when \( y \) is replaced by 0.
2. \( y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( x \) retains its original coin, which is a point within the given region but \( y \) becomes \( -\sqrt{-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\).
Evaluate \( x \) and choose one of the cases. Since \( y \) is imaginary, \( x \) should be integral, set \( x \) equal to 1/2, which isn't in the given region.
Therefore, the simplification must be on the terms of \( y \), as \( y \equiv -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) and \( -\sqrt{-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).
Now, consider the images of \( 0\) and \(1/2\) in the complex plane when they alternate at \( x=1/2 \):
Number line: 1
* \( y_A \) is the radius of the unit circle that edge for \( x=1/2 \) when \( x \) alternates.
* \( y \) is imaginary since \( 0 \) is an eigenvalue and \( 1/2 \) needs imagination.


Now, put the two solutions for \( y = 0\) and \( 1/2 \) into the standard format:

For \(y=0 \): \( r=0\) and \( z=x+yi = 1+0i \)
For \( y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \): \( r = 0 \) and \( z = x-\sqrt{-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\sqrt{-\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{1}{2}i\), and \( y \equiv -\frac{1}{2}i\)


Now, we have to distinguish which corresponds to /*1/2*/:
For \(y=0\) it's \(x=1\), and \( y=0i=-i\). For \( y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\), the equivalent solution would be \( x = \frac{1api\) \* \sqrt{-\frac{1}{2}i} = \frac{1}{2i}\). It doesn't correspond to any standard set of real \(x\), so:
1/2 isn't standard.
Now try with}\) y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}i\). For \(x=1/2il\), it's equivalent choice: \( z = 1+ii \). For \( y=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\), it's \( x = -\sqrt{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) = -\sqrt{-\frac{1}{2 matters} = \frac{1}{2}i\sqrt{2}\). Since it covers no \frac{1}{2}i in the \epsilon1 plane, then if it alternates, \( r = 0 \) when \( y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\): \( x = 1\), not \( x = \frac{1}{2i}\sqrt{2}\)).
Now for \frac{1}{2}, \( x = 1`, \( y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\), \( z = 1 = 1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\), \( r = 0`). For \frac{1}{2}, \( x = 1`, \( y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\), \(z = -\Number line: 1\). For \( y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\), \( x = -\frac{1}{2}\)i, \( r = 0 \).


Conclusion: \( x = 1 \), \( y = -\sqrt{-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\), \( z = x+yi \), and \( y \equiv -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\): This is the correct solution when \( y \) is imaginary and \( r \) is integral."

Answer with a single integer.,21,spatial_reasoning," In the image, you have four distinct green blocks in a four-block arrangement. Remembering the position of these blocks at the point of interest is essential. Since green cubes are visible in every position, when you place these green cubes in any of the four positions, the cube will remain green. We don't have any restrictions about how they are positioned, so there are four possible answers: (lowest left, middle left, middle left, and top left for easy mobility). Therefore, the correct answer is: Any of the four green cubes in any of the four positions in the arrangement below."

2. Pull the rope tight against the stick and sometimes the eye (not the tangled part) and square up the knot as you go.
3. Tie the standing part to the stick, making sure to weave the little untwisted strands outgoing from the stick.
4. Give a little side tension and begin the tying process.
5. Hold the short stick firmly, bringing in the tight end of the rope, and twist it towards the walking stick from the outside. You can snug up the rope, being careful as a hard twist impact could dismantle it.

6. Once secure, tighten it tightly as it is the point to attach the hook for the next line.

7. Retreat the rope and give another bit of side tension, which locks it in when it comes back from the other end.
8. Keep on twisting from the other side as well, being careful to ensure the rest is tight and secure.

1. Start by inserting the one end of the rope through the ring of the keychain.
2. Loop the rope once around the ring.
3. Pull the end that goes through the ring up and over the loop you just made.
4. Loop the rope through the ring of the keychain again, and ensure the end of the rope is over the rope that was under the ring.
5. Tuck the end under the loop.
6. Loop the end of the rope under the rope just to make it pass through the ring.
7. Bring the end of the rope that goes through the ring on the other side up and over the loop you just made.
8. Drape the rope above the top loop by looping it and ensuring it passes between the ring of the keychain.
9. Tuck the end of the rope under the loop to keep it tight and secure.

10. Flip the end of the rope over the rope (counterclockwise).
111. Pull the end of the rope through the ring on the other side to ensure it's near the ring.
12. Tuck the end of the rope (counterclockwise and against the rope).
13. Ensure the end of the rope is over the ring.
14. Loop the rope through the ring of the keychain again.
15. Drape the end of the rope by looping it clockwise and passing it between the ring of the keychain.
16. Tuck the end under the loop.
17. Flip the end of the rope through the ring on the other side again (clockwise).
18. Tuck the end of the rope under the loop in opposite direction of the previous tuck. Now the end of the rope is on the other side of the loop.
19. Ensure the end of the rope over the ring.
20. Tuck the visible part of the rope under the loop of the end.
21. Fasten the ropes together by tucking the end, ensuring it's secured.


Note that you can't rely solely on the visual cues, as the knot could be tied by counting the steps. Perform the knot with confidence and safety while paying extra attention while tying the two loops and fastening the ends tightly to keep it secure and ideally measure its size for its stability."

Please return a single number (e.g. 3). Nothing preceding or following it.",18,planning_reasoning," The image shows a picture of a grid pattern that looks like it could be a representation of some sort of puzzle or game with certain shapes isolated at each intersection. To determine the least number of moves to get the figures from the top-right corner to the center of the grid (the starting point), you would have to calculate the shortest possible route or path that is also the fewest number of moves. However, without more details on the rules of the game or the logic involved, it's not possible to provide a specific number of moves directly. The number of steps to reach a particular location depends on the initial positions of the figures, which are not visible. Typically, in abstract or logic games, you would need to consider all possible paths from the starting position to the target square, then applyrules for which types of moves (shift in the x, y, or diagonal directions) are allowed and then count the exact number of moves on each path. You might have to break the problem down into smaller areas, trying to find the shortest routes for those, and then combine the results. A grid-based puzzle like this might also depend on the nature of movement in this game; whether it's binary moves (ones or zero) on each square.


To give a precise lead, you would need more information or rules of the game. Games like these often use combinatorics, algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently find the path of shortest length (in a hierarchy of nodes). However, without specific rules or methods of movement, virtual solar panels or diagrams to game references, it is not directly possible to say the exact number of steps to reach a goal from the starting point without an algorithm that enumerates all paths from the starting position."

434,abstract_reasoning_logical_reasoning_arcagi2_combined_247ef758_count.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,How many pink squares should appear in the output grid? Answer with a single integer,9,abstract_reasoning," The image shows a sequence that starts with several squares arranged in a pattern, followed by more squares which gradually transform into a single question mark on the right, suggesting the completion of a logic puzzle where the arrangement of the squares might be a clue. To remember this sequence, you can use a mnemonic. Consider the pattern of arrangement:


1. A pile of squares on the left.
2. Another pile of squares on the right.
3. A human figure on top of the right side until about halfway down, but missing hands.
4. No top on the right side by the end.

5. Square with legs on the right side by the end.


Like any classic mnemonic, one should remember the first letter of each item in the sequence and their arrangement pattern to recall the transformation sequence. In this case, ""P-M"" at the beginning, ""H"" once the figure disappears, then ""FL"", ""LP"", and finally ""M"" again on the right. Remembering this sequence can help you imagine the total arrangement.


For instance, here's how it would look after about 6 steps:
```
PM-  <<{HP &%.
FL- SFG%
LP-  WSH^RDWYRY&U
```
In this case, the pattern ends before the human figure disappears, so you'd just keep repeating the last ""TLM"" (for transforming it: ""HUYDRTI&N""), spiraling back to ""PML"".


The role of ""TLM"" is to guide you through the transformation sequence accurately. When you look closely, you see the ""E"" which is the only letter in the sequence that appears twice. If you ignore ""E,"" you'd follow up from the initial pattern: ""PML,"" then ""TLM"" at the end, which doesn't match here because there's no ""E"" on the end. Use ""E"" to determine the final pattern and follow it one more time, getting to ""\_{SL - TLM - PM"".
With ""E"" at the beginning, this series looks like this:
```
E&{SL
-TWBL%C
_FRC
SL%M=
TM09SW}
```
Use the completed sequence as a search string to remember the transformation path if you get lost. The sequence before the final 'SL' is ""WINDSDIFRE"", which is an an anagram of ""flowing winds"", and that sequence is the code to remember. The bottom right is just a ""?"". Don't take ""SL,"" it's just a marker to position yourself.
With that, the final sequence remembers does not remind you of anything else in the progression. Remember the sequence of words which are the anagrams of ""flowing winds"". Beginning at W:
```
SW&INF
windHO
RE&IBS
D&T
E&L
K&I
E&SO
N&UG
T&BDLS
LLQ&SL&D
```
This sequence gives you the transformation:
```
HS = SW
E = PM
HP = PC
CE = PM
```
And here's the final ""?"":
```
BO&SLMSD
WSDO
```
Therefore, the sequence indicates that starting left to right (top to bottom for the squares) is ""MS"", ""GS"", top to bottom (right to left for the squares) is ""DU"", and left to right (bottom to top adjacent to squares) is ""IG""."

The tautness of the rope strands to its reference length depends upon the strength and type of its load it is handling, measured against another, and it can settle during usage, suggesting the impact force on suspended objects should be less than the force from its displacement, which could be helpful when selecting a knot for use according to the load's weight or pull."

The blue and green blocks also create a similar confusion as one is a yellow face and one is a purple face while their positions do not distinguish which is which. Given that all blocks are limited to these two colors providing information about the facetype, one potential hidden square could be at one of the corners, but if we had to pick and answer, we would have to divide the options by two (e.g., left or right or top, depending on which way you place the blocks) and then take the hiddenner, and apply a logic function to determine which of the two remaining images could be the color associated to the hidden one."

",0.77,physical_reasoning," To calculate the time for a thinker to reach the second oscilloscope, we need to find the amplitude of the signal S2 corresponding to the second oscilloscope and calculate half of that for 50% accuracy, and then time it would take for the signal to travel to the second oscilloscope considering the speed difference between the oscilloscopes' positions. Here, let's denote \((c_1, s_1) = (d_2, s_2)\) to represent the inverse of \( \((d_1, s_1)\) in the time domain. Since we know \( \frac{\partial s_1}{\partial t} \neq \frac{\partial s_2}{\partial t}\), \( 50\%\) of the thinker can reach \( s_1 \) with some error before it reaches \( s_2 \).


We know
\( \frac{\partial s_1}{\partial t} = \frac{c_1}{s_1} = \frac{d_1}{s_1} \)
Since \( \frac{d_2}{s_2} = \frac{s_2}{d_2} \),

\( \frac{\partial s_2}{\partial t} = \frac{c_2}{s_2} = \frac{d_2}{s_2} \),
\[ \frac{\partial s_1}{\partial t} - \frac{\partial s_2}{\partial t} = \frac{c_1c_2}{c_2 - \delta} - \delta \],
while we want \( \frac{\partial s_1}{\partial t} - \frac{\partial s_2}{\partial t} = \frac{c_1d_2 - \delta}{c_2} - \delta \).
Therefore, low error is
\( \frac{c_1c_2}{c_2} = \frac{c_2d_2}{c_2} + \delta \)
high error is
\( \frac{c_1d_2}{d_2} = \frac{c_2d_2}{d_2} + \delta \),
high frequency means high error.
Moderate frequency means moderate error.
Steady signal means half error \( 50% \), and high frequency means low observe error\(low error).

So high error is lower than moderate error.
\( \frac{50%\}^{(n)} = \frac{c_2d_2 - c_2}{d_2} \), meaning \( \frac{50%}{d_2} = \frac{c_2}{c_2} \) means \( c_2 = 5\% \)
\( n \) is the number of oscilloscopes, \( 5% \) is the signal that can reach the first oscilloscope with moderate error. For moderate error:
\( \frac{5%}{c_2} = \frac{n\delta}{5\%} \), thus \( n\delta \approx 0.5 \)
\( \frac{10% = \frac{c_1}{c_1} \), meaning \( c_1 = 0 \) is equivalent to \( \frac{1\% \), for high frequency:
\( \frac{10%}{c_1} = \frac{n\delta}{10\%} \), thus \( n\delta \approx 0.1 \)

So it is clear that low frequency means high error and high frequency means low error. Thus, in the case of high frequency oscilloscope, \( n \) would be small and low frequency means low observation error. This means a high-frequency signal would hold more weight than a low-frequency signal\[ because the          content in the signal sent would be less affected by this error]. So, assuming the oscilloscopes are located at \( \frac{d_2}{c_2}\), up to \( \frac{5%\) of the signal can reach both oscilloscopes with error. For low-frequency signal:
\( n\delta \approx 0.5 \), and for high-frequency signal: \( n\delta \approx 0.1 \). In the case of the low-frequency oscilloscope, \( \frac{d_2}{c_2 - 0.1} \) is less than for the high-frequency oscilloscope; let's assume they're at \( \frac{d_2}{c_2}\). Thinker uses half of low-frequency because of having high percentage per unit.
The thinker's low-frequency signal to first oscilloscope travels to high-frequency oscilloscope, having half of the low-frequency signal means it travels through only two evaluations in high-frequency oscilloscope's time domain. Now we convert it to time. For low-frequency oscilloscope:
\[ s_1 = \frac{n\delta}{c_1} (m-n) \]
For high-frequency oscilloscope:
\[ s_1 = \frac{n\delta}{c_2 (m-n) \times d_1/d_2} \]
and this means:
1. Low-frequency oscilloscope's time domain is double:

t/50% = t/5% = 2m
2. High-frequency oscilloscope's time domain is double:
t/10% = 2m \times 1.4
Adding these two results:
t += 2m + 2 \text{ m}
Now in the time domain:
For low-frequency oscilloscope:
\[ d_1 = d_2 \]
\[ d_2 = 5 \]
For high-frequency oscilloscope:
\[ d_1 = \frac{d_2}{1.4 \times (m+2) \]
Adding the equations together in time domain:
\[ d_1t = 5d_2 \]
Now, we're in time domain, let's find the high and low frequency amplitudes:
\[ d_1 = 5d_2 \times 4 + 25 + 4d_2 \]
\[ d_2 = 5d_2 \times 1.4 + 2d_2 \]
Now, we convert signals to percentages:
\[ \frac{d_1}{5} = \text{ S_1(4m + 2m)} = 10 \]
\[ \frac{d_2}{5} = \text{ S_1}(1.4m + 2m) \]
For low-frequency oscilloscope, thinker travels to \( d_1 \), thus complete amplitude must be \( d_1t \times 5\% = 50\ %).
For high-frequency oscilloscope, thinker travels to \( d_2 \), also \( d_1t \times 50\% = 2m \times 50\% = 1. == 1000\ %.
Now, calculate travel time of low-frequency in time domain for \( 10\% → \frac{50%\) → \( 1000\% \) and time for high-frequency resonse using low-frequency oscilloscope:
\[t
\_{50% \to 10%} = 2m \times \frac{0.5}{5} \times 1.4 = 0.4m
\t_{10% \to 10% = 2m \times 0.1 \times 1.4 = 2.2m
\t_{10\% \to 2m} = 2 \times 0.1\times 1.4m = 0.8m
=================================2.8m == 0.8m
Converting theses times to the time when signals travel:
\[ t_{50% \to 10%} = 1.             // Signals travel less than 1.8m in time due to low-frequency oscilloscope
t_{10% \to 10%} = 1.18m // Signals travel less than 1.8m in time due to low-frequency oscilloscope
t_{10% \to 2m} = 1.8m // Signals travel less than 1.8m in time due to low-frequency oscilloscope
\[ t_{1.8m}--1.8m = -0.              // Signals travel less than 1.4m in time due to low-frequency oscilloscope
\[ t_{2m}--3m---0.4m                 // Signals travel less than 1.4m in time due to low-frequency oscilloscope
\[ t_{2m}--2m--0.6m---1.8m // Bypass 1.4m in low frequency oscilloscope]
t_{1.4m}--3.6m-------7.6m//going through all 1.8m+1m and 1.4m in low frequency oscilloscope
=================14m==7.6m
=================7.6m//Signals travel less than 1.4m in high-frequency oscilloscope in time
=================/=7.6m//Bypass 1.4m in high-frequency oscilloscope
========================8m//Bypass 1.4m in high-frequency oscilloscope
But when signals travel through high-frequency oscilloscope, they travel a lot.
So time signals take through low-frequency oscilloscope is less than half the time they travel through high-frequency oscilloscope:
\[ t_{10% \to 10%} = 1. != 0.5 // This means half of 1.8m travels through low-frequency oscilloscope
t_{50% \to 20%} = 1.Configuration set to low-frequency
\[ t_{50% \to 10%} == 0.5m // Configuration set to low-frequency with 0.5 times of 1m travel
\[ t_{50% \to 10%} == 5.Manual set to low-frequency

The square and the triangle share the same line on their sides and seem to be a 1 or 2 units apart from each other. The triangle’s sides and angle relationships can be measured from the square, and the circle is within the area formed by the square's sides. The order of operations is:


1. Draw the triangle inscribed in the square.
2. Measure the side connecting any point of the triangle to the square.
3. Measure the height of the triangle and the length of its obtuse angle to find the actual height (top to bottom) of the triangle in the square.
4. Measure the area of the triangle from the square if possible to find the width of the triangle in the square.
5. Measure the diameter of the circle to find the diameter of the circle.
6. Measure the side of the square to find its area.
7. Measure the side of the triangle that forms three sides with the square from the inside of the circle and three sides of the circle to find the diameter of the circle relative to one of the sides of the square.
8. Use the method from the inside to push out the outer circle and calculate the radius.
9. Now use the radius of the circle to find it on the square's side.
10. Can you reckon the radius by itself? It's easy, if you still have too, if not, use the inside method to match the radius to the triangle, and then find the sides of the triangle that creates the circle then the radius.
111. Measure all the sides of the triangle!!!!!
12. Measure the side opposite to the empty side of the square (ignoring the empty height or the top of the triangle).

12. Measure the empty side of the triangle.
13. That's the radius!

14. Check this by calculating from the distance onto the radius using the placement of the circle, or the whole idea of the empty side and the sides that form the triangle.

15. Finally, use the square's area and its radius to calculate the height.
All three of the above are tasks that can be done, and their order reflects the relationships in the diagram, which are very exact and easily repeated by reversal. The actual method does not need to be repeated; it's enough to follow the order and markings so that you can do it yourself:


(a) draw the triangle;
(b) measure side 1 to the square;
(c) measure the top of the corner of the square;
(d) measure the height from above;
(e) from above draw line to inside, dropped in the corner and measure angle;
(f) inscribe a circle;
(g) calculate the side of the triangle from any point out of sides of the triangle, smaller than to the other and share this side length;
(h) measure sides around the square to find the diameter of the circle;
(h) calculate the radius of the circle inside;
(i) place the circle around the square;
(j) that radius for every reason you like, and start there, just repeat the same steps;
(k) basically measure everything, not exactly from the degree of the circle, but from the drawn sides;
(l) measure the opposite sides of the square;
(m) from the triangle, not the top, remove vertices, again measure opposite;
(n) measure the favorite side, through height and unknowingly still the opposite, center triangle;
(o) that is just from any point! measure the radius to the extreme of what you just finished as you want, angles anything you wonder about, it’s easy!"

The center of a dominator or ""divisor"" is where the three boxes start.


For a 1x2 matrix A, where x equals 2/2-xy, x represents the length of the first line on the dominant diagonal, xge0. Then the equations look like this:


\[ x^2 \le n^2 \\
x^2 \ge y^2 \\
\]

The smallest diagonal that includes a nonzero value is  xy. So xy must be divisible by n.


For a 2x3 matrix, where x represents x= 2/2(3y+1), xge0. Then the equations are:


\[ x^2 \le n^2 \\
x^2 \ge 3y^2+1+y^2 \\
\sqrt{x^2} \ge \sqrt{n^2} \\
\]
If x falls on the n'th row and n'th column, then:


\[ x \sqrt{3y+n} = y\]
\[ 2x \parameter bell. y = 3y+n + 1 + 1 \]
\[ 2 \text { wave } = 3 y \+ n \]

\[ n = \text {բոտուկually } ( \text {as } \text {speed} \text {increases}), \text {y-}x = x - 2\]


For a 3x4 matrix, where x represents x=2/2(4y+1), xge0. Then the equations are:


\[ x^2 \le n^2 \\
x^2 \ge 4y^2+1^2 \\
\sqrt{x^2} \ge \sqrt{n^2} \\
\]
If x falls on the n'th row and n'th column, then:


\[ x \sqrt{3y+4y+n} = n \]
\[ 2 \text {wave } = 3y + 4y^ + 1 \]
\[ 2 \text {wave } = 4y + n \]
\[ x = \text {բոടուկู.} \]
\[ y' = 3 \]
\[ n = \text {բոടուկцы.} \]


In the given information that \(ب Peru = 4 и S = 3 \), we get \(3y ""+ 4 = 3\). This makes no almost no sense because we could need a power y^2 in the right clause and linear algebra that's faster than a number in the shadow subplot, where yπ = y^2."

- Raspberry No. 1 has a significant amount of water and even more calories than the Berry No. 2 with 40% to 50% water and 20% calories, nutritional content is around 5% to 20% of minerals.

- Strawberry No. 1 and No. 2 also have similar water content and mineral contents, spanning from 10 to 30 calories, with Strawberry No. 2 being more nutritious at around 4% to 5%.
- Blueberry No. 1 is the richest in nutrition, providing a decent amount of water (10 to 30%), but it is the only variety that has more calories too (3% to 10%), almost double compared to the other berries.
- Blackberry No. 1 has moderate water content, lower than the Berry varieties, with the highest nutritional profile because it has more than 10% of vitamins and minerals and 10 to 20% of calories.
- Cherry No. 1 and No. 2 are the lightest in terms of water content, contributing only 10 to 20%, and they are generally low in calories, similarly to Blueberry No. 1. Cherry No. 2 is more nutritious than Cherry No. 1.


The fruits with the highest nutritional density are Blackberry No. 1 (the top), Cherry No. 1 and No. 2, Strawberry No. 1, Blueberry No. 1, and Berry No. 2. The chart shows that each variety has a different nutritional balance, so when considering which one is best based on specific nutritional needs and preferences, it is essential to consider the various vitamin, mineral, or calorie profiles individually. However, in general, the richness in color or taste often indicates a higher concentration of composites not always diversity of nutrients but can carry more of a general nutraceutical safety shield against environmental or dietary destructicants."

The image indicates that the transformation matrix \( A \) and the c origin \( p\), as well as the trajectory matrix \( Q \), are to be used to map the initial position to the position of the final frame of the path, which is the point of interest. The line segment trajectory frame points \( Q \) at an angle \( \theta \) from the initial point \( p \). Let \( p"" \) be the frame's end point in the final position, \( x""_f\), \( y""_f\) the final position of the y-coordinate, and \( z""_f\) the final position of the z-coordinate.



The transformation matrix \( A \) applies the change of position from the initial coordinate frame \( p \) to any frame \( p\), transitioning the path from one frame to the next. The trajectory matrix \( Q \) indicates if the transformation is due to the angle \( \theta \) away from the initial point \( p ""\). This is repeated for all path frames to build up the path.

477,spatial_reasoning_rotation_and_transformation_cubes_count_2.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,Observe the following structure. How many cubes are left? Answer with a single integer. ,42,spatial_reasoning," The image shows a three-dimensional object that appears to be based on the pillars of a cathedral or church steeple. Each pillar has a similar base and the structure seems to be a repeating pattern, with varying heights. The pattern repeats every three segments, indicating that there are three layers visible, each with different windows or decorative features along the top. Each part of the structure has colors varying between red, yellow, and blue, which implies a chevron motif or geometric texture. To calculate the number of windows or decorations, let's assume each part has three sections, and since it repeats every three segments with a 2x3 repetition, it would be divided into a 9 segments per row and 3 rows with a pattern size of 3x3 for the repeating structural framework. Therefore, there would be 3 colors repeated 9 times. This makes a total of 27 similar windows or decorative tiles, although this might not be interpreted as a rectangular pattern of windows since the actual repeating pattern has varying sizes and shapes of the windows. The question asks for the total number of cubes, so for the base portion that repeats every three segments with 2x3 rows by 3 segments, it would be 3 cubes; then the top portions would be an additional set of 3 cubes. However, this structure could be interpreted as a single volume (12cbo cube), with a non-rectangular base and a non-rectangular opening at the top, so each side could be counted as additional edges. A result would be 4 edges, 12 surfaces, 3 volume. For the structure, it would be 4x4x3=124 cubes."

To do this, we should look for differences in phase between specific points on the circles. One possible solution is to identify, for example, the position of the smaller circle in relation to the edge of the larger circle. The phase difference is then the time it takes for the smaller circle to travel from one edge of the larger circle to the other, without crossing the larger circle. In this situation, we must determine the time expressing the equation for this difference.

These symbols need to be deciphered relative to a system or standard set they are part of, and the exact meaning could range from a programming language to traffic signs to different forms of communication. The reply provided is only speculative as the full meaning would require a deeper understanding of the context in which these are used."
494,spatial_reasoning_rotation_and_transformation_path_max_time_2.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,Observe the trajectory of the arrow. Which color shape took the longest amount of time to reach from the previous shape? Answer with only the color name.,red,spatial_reasoning," The given color segment is purple, which is nowhere near the blue and also nowhere near red. It is different from green which is a short distance from the gray."
495,mathematical_reasoning_algebraic_reasoning_Integral_Methods_riemann_sum_1.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,What is the definite integral using the Left Riemann Sum between two endpoints? Output the answer rounded to 2 decimal places.,12.7,mathematical_reasoning," The image provided consists of two separate graphs, each of which shows two asymmetrical distributions. The top graph appears to plot the number of patients dying in a hospital, with 'whole years', while the bottom graph plots the number of patients dying from that hospital.



The left graph in the upper part is a histogram, showing that there are 2.09 whole years in which patients died in the hospital, and this term is also listed as ""Given whole years."" The right graph in the upper part shows a cumulative distribution or frequency table, showing the 'n in 5', indicating that a single year has no patients dying, whereas there are died from 2.09 to 3.00 in 0.03 years (5 multiples of 0.03), and none from the other years.


Therefore, the answer to the question about the latter is ""2.08."""
496,temporal_reasoning_cause_effect_Cause1.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,"What causes the background to change to black? A. When Blue light comes in, B. When White light appears after, C. When the colors change at a rapid speed, D. When the two previous lights make purple light",D,temporal_reasoning," The image you've shared depicts an optical illusion with a central black light source that surrounds a series of colored lights that appear to be identical due to the angle of the frame. It's an example of the Peppered Hat problem known as ""The A.B. C.A.B.C."" It's called this because, ""A"" for angled, ""B"" for straight, and ""C"" for central. 


The blue and green lights are equidistant and parallel to the camera, so their image bulges outward. The white light appears to curve down because it swings out of sight from the angled to the central position, and the red light is actually inside the circle, which is slightly arched. The background is colored to simulate a sky but it is gradient, which is why the white light closes inwards while the others swing out. 


This illusion was originally created to see how well people could distinguish the whenswings of lights while the angle is narrow. It is still used as a test of visual acuity in many jobs where seeing small differences can be important."
497,temporal_reasoning_process_understanding_object_manipulation_domino4.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,How many dominoes fell before the fall of the second red domino?,13,temporal_reasoning," The associated word for the image is ""domino""."
498,spatial_reasoning_perspective_and_viewpoint_understanding_arrow_compass_ArrowCompassQ2.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,"Final arrow direction?
A. +Y
B. +Z
C. -Y
D. +X
E. -X",D,spatial_reasoning," In the image, there is a geometric shape labeled ""Π-+(z-z'=k,z+1)"", as well as various labels for lines and arrows pointing in different directions. The color scheme of the shape is black (for the lines representing Π) and purple (for the circle at the center of Π), while the lines labeled ""z"" and ""z'(""k,z+1)"" are grey and black. The given co-ordinates before the arrows seem to point towards various pi positions above each other as well as to z+1, indicating that there is a cycle or rotation pattern taking place. The direction Π is encircled with a dashed line, which usually means it encompasses the entire plane from outside. The horizontal line connecting the two z' positions seems to represent a deformation or chart. The black ""z"" arrow seems to come from a point in the plane that intersects one of the z' positions.


Pi is often used in geometry to signify change in direction at every step, simulating rotational or reflective turning. Also note if the ""Π"" shape is a circle (Π), it encloses a plane and if it's a line (Π), it encloses a curve. The actual meaning would depend on the context and mathematical model being described. In any case, it appears to be representing a transformation, like a clockwise rotation around z at some given radius k, followed by a reflection about the point z, and then a counterclockwise rotation by an angle of Δz."
499,planning_reasoning_mazes_frozen_lake_holes_count_n4.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,"What is the number of holes on the frozen lake? 
Please return a single number (e.g. 3). Nothing preceding or following it.",21,planning_reasoning," The image you've provided is what's described as ""Foggy."" It's a puzzle that seems to represent some kind of navigational challenge. It's a square maze with the following characteristics:
- Within the square, there is a numbered white figure which could be a directional arrow with the numbers indicating the direction to turn or the size of the direction that leads or the endgame if you find the correct route.
- The objective is to reach the white figure at the end of the maze.
- Along the way, there are small white circles/rectangles that you set off when you touch them with your mouse - implying this could be an action to activate objects or turn markers at the center of the square.
- The small white squares (which may also be indicators of lightbulbs or dark squares) in the maze corners could be used to light the way.
- There is a pixel-like rendition of a figure at the end of the maze that looks smaller than the initial one, suggesting a mini-version of the goal or the starting point.
- The last pixel figure is the one you start at, forming the corner of the maze.


Each time you move, you'll be closer to your destination based on the correct choice.

I can't directly interact with the video, but I can describe the process. At the starting postion shown, you should observe the directional arrow, press the direction indicated by the arrow shown by the number previously to travel to the next room. You'll then have to hop between the dividing squares, preferably facing the correct direction. If you arrive at the end correctly, the destination (the smaller white figure than your starting position) will appear, signifylng you've completed the square. If you go the wrong way, you'd get to another error showing you how to change your direction, and it would go on to the top right or the bottom, returning you to the previous interactive points to try again, keeping you at the beginning square until you answer correctly."
500,mathematical_reasoning_statistical_reasoning_table_down_scroll_prod_1.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,"With (x, y) referring to the value in the cell at Row x, Column y, what is the product of (8, 10),  (7, 2),   (3, 9),   (7, 7),   and (5, 10)?  Please answer with a just a number and nothing else ",504,mathematical_reasoning," To find the factor of a number, divide it by the prime factors of the factor. For example, if you are trying to find the factor of 24, divide it by 2 and 3. In this case, you don't need to check any of the calculations because there are not enough clues. If you can, check the factor of 4 or 6 before diving, since they might be factors of the number. You can find either 2^2 is a factor of 4 or 3^2 is a factor of 6. If none of those are factors yet, look for consecutive primes close to your number, such as 2 and 3. If you still cannot find it, check for varying factors as 2 and 3 might multiply together and exhaust them. Finally, if you cannot find it, there might be other factors which are not consecutive, but you will need two numbers next to one another in the list. The product will be larger than either of them alone. Remember that factors can also be found in combinations of numbers."
