6,abstract_reasoning_logical_reasoning_arcagi2_combined_7b0280bc_count.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,How many light gray squares should appear in the output grid? Answer with a single integer,38,abstract_reasoning,"First, it turns out nothing mystical was hiding in the colour‐name table – the programme is simply detecting every cell of the “snake” that is **not** a 90° turn and repainting those cells light‐gray, whilst marking each corner with green.  In other words

  #light‐gray = total path‐cells − number of 90° turns.

If you count through the yellow‐background/blue‐path picture you get

  • total blue‐path cells = 24  
  • of those 6 are corner‐turns  

so

  24 − 6  = 18

Hence the correct answer is:

  **18 light‐gray squares**."

",B,physical_reasoning,"If you call θ the angle the tangent to the cycloid makes with the horizontal, then the tangential component of the acceleration is

135,abstract_reasoning_logical_reasoning_arcagi2_combined_a395ee82_count.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,How many dark red squares should appear in the output grid? Answer with a single integer,430,abstract_reasoning,"Here is the simplest way to see what is going on (and to get to the final count of dark‐red cells) without getting lost in all the examples:

1.  In each example you have two “input” shapes on a grid, each in a different colour.  One of them we call the “stencil” (or generator) and the other we call the “stamp” (or template).  

2.  To form the output you **stamp** a copy of the template at every cell occupied by the stencil.  In symbols, if the stencil covers cells S and the template (in its own little bounding box) covers cells T (measured from some anchor point), then the output is

      ⋃_{s ∈ S} (T + s)

   i.e. translate T to each s in S and take the union of all those translated copies.

3.  The colour of the output‐pixels is just the template‐colour (drawn in its darker “output” shade so you can tell it is the result).

---

**Final puzzle**  
On the dark-red background you see:

  – A little **pink** template up near the top.  
  – A small **yellow** stencil down in the lower-left, in the shape of a little 1+2+3+4 triangle (10 yellow squares).

By the rule just stated you must take the pink template and **stamp** it once at each of those 10 yellow positions, then take the union.

Because none of those 10 placements overlap (they are spaced far enough apart), the total number of dark‐red output squares is simply

   (# of stencil cells) × (# of template cells).

- The stencil (yellow) has 10 cells.
- The template (pink) has 6 cells (you can count them in the picture).

So the output will contain

   10 × 6  =  60

dark‐red squares in all."

(A) The original incident wave is completely canceled because the phases of the spherical waves emitted from each point vary.
(B) It visualizes Huygens� principle that every point acts as a secondary point source emitting waves.
(C) The spherical waves always have greater amplitude than the incident wave.
(D) Secondary waves are emitted only at the boundary of the medium.",B,physical_reasoning,"The correct answer is (B).  The yellow circle is showing Huygens’ idea that every point on a wavefront acts like a little secondary source emitting its own spherical wavelet.  Options (A), (C), and (D) all contradict the Huygens–Fresnel picture: (A) there is no wholesale “complete cancellation” of the original wave, (C) the secondary wavelets in fact have typically smaller amplitudes (they build up by superposition), and (D) the wavelets emanate from every point on the wavefront (or within the medium under Fresnel’s refinement), not just at a boundary."

185,physical_reasoning_physics_FeynmanRefreaction_FeynmanRefractionModelQ4.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,"When the first blue incident wavefront reaches the left boundary of the gray medium layer, what is the leftmost red charge point doing?
(A) It has already started oscillating.
(B) It is momentarily stopped just before oscillation.
(C) It is oscillating at maximum phase.
(D) It is still at rest.",D,physical_reasoning,"The key is that nothing in the medium “knows” that the wave is coming until the very first crest‐front (blue line) actually arrives at the boundary.  Up to that instant the little red charges have sat quietly at their equilibrium positions (zero displacement and zero velocity).  The moment that front reaches them the field jumps to its peak value and so the charges have their maximum acceleration – but no time has yet elapsed for any finite displacement or velocity to build up.  In other words, at that instant the charge is still momentarily at rest, just on the verge of its first oscillation.  That is exactly choice B."

They remove the front‐right‐bottom corner, (x,y,z)=(4,1,1).

1.  A full 4³ cube has 8 corners, each with 3 exposed faces.  Removing (4,1,1) knocks out one of those, so 7 of the original corners remain with 3 exposed faces.

2.  The three cubes that shared a face with the removed cube—namely at  
   (3,1,1), (4,2,1) and (4,1,2)—each gain one extra exposed face (their face against (4,1,1) is now open).  Each of those three thus goes from 2 exposed faces up to 3.

(B) A larger g rescales both r and \theta_f equally, leaving the curve identical.
(C) Numerical sampling density is fixed, hiding any change.
(D) Air resistance exactly cancels the g dependence.",A,physical_reasoning,"The punch‐line is that gravity simply drops out of the Euler–Lagrange equation for the brachistochrone, so the *shape* of the cycloid is independent of g.  All that g does is set the overall time scale – increasing g just uniformly rescales the cycloid parameters (the “radius” and final angle) so that the curve looks identical, only traversed in a shorter time.

Suppose the same 600 line/mm grating is illuminated with a red laser (λ ≈ 650 nm) at an incident angle of 30° relative to the grating normal. Approximately what will the first-order diffraction angle θ₁ (measured from the normal) be?
A. ≈ 10°
B. ≈ 20°
C. ≈ 30°
D. ≈ 40°",D,physical_reasoning,"We have a 600 mm⁻¹ grating so  
 d = 1/(600 × 10³ m⁻¹) ≃ 1.67 μm  
and λ ≃ 650 nm ⇒ λ/d ≃ 0.65/1.67 ≃ 0.39.  

For m=1 and θᵢ=30°, the grating equation with the “+” sign is  
 d (sin θᵢ + sin θ₁) = λ  
⇒ sin θ₁ = (λ/d) – sin θᵢ ≃ 0.39 – 0.50 = –0.11  
⇒ θ₁ ≃ arcsin(–0.11) ≃ –6.3°

On a straight incline the bead accelerates at g sin θ′ where θ′ is just the (constant) incline-angle, whereas on the cycloid the tangential acceleration is g sin θ.

Fᵧ(x,y) =  1.0·x – 0.6·x²

In the plane, the only nonzero component of curl F is the “out‐of‐plane” (z–) component

curl F·ẑ = ∂Fᵧ/∂x  –  ∂Fₓ/∂y.

Step–by–step:

1) ∂Fᵧ/∂x = ∂(x – 0.6 x²)/∂x = 1 – 1.2 x  
2) ∂Fₓ/∂y = ∂(–y + 0.6 x y)/∂y = –1 + 0.6 x

1.  In the training examples any “+”-shaped cluster of dark-red pixels is carried forward intact – its arm‐length never changes.

Answer with a single integer,0,abstract_reasoning,"The key is that the output column is formed by “reading off” the right‐most cell of each input row (as in the worked‐through examples).  In your last board, none of the rows have a light-gray cell at their right edge – they’re all either yellow or pink.  Therefore zero light-gray squares ever make it into the output column."

493,temporal_reasoning_process_understanding_object_manipulation_numShape3.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,What is the difference between the third number and the one that appeared before the prism? \n\n Round to 2 decimal place.,0.00,temporal_reasoning,"First, let’s agree on what “the third number” and “the one that appeared before the prism” are in the video:

 1. The first volume‐number shown is under the bent‐pipe.
 2. The second volume‐number is under the torus.
 3. The third volume‐number is under the sphere.
 4. The volume shown just before the rectangular prism is the cone’s volume.

So the question is really

   (volume of the sphere)  −  (volume of the cone)
   
Reading off the video (and using the exact same values they did)

  • Sphere Vₛ = 33.51 cm³  
  • Cone V_c = 20.94 cm³  

Hence

   Vₛ − V_c = 33.51 cm³ − 20.94 cm³ = 12.57 cm³  

Rounded to two decimal places that is

   **12.57 (cm³)**."

When the two previous lights make purple light",D,temporal_reasoning,"In that little “slide‐show” the only time you ever get black is immediately after you’ve shown red + blue back-to-back (i.e. when the two preceding frames would add up to purple).  Every time the two previous colours would have mixed to give you purple, the screen goes black instead.  Hence choice D."
