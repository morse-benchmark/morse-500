Output only the letter of the correct answer,D,mathematical_reasoning,"To determine the z-component of the curl of the vector field \(\mathbf{F}(x, y) = (-1.4y + 1.1xy)\mathbf{i} + (1.4x - 1.1x^2)\mathbf{j}\) at the green point (presumably the origin \((0, 0)\)), we follow these steps.

### **Curl formula in 2D**
The curl of a 2D vector field \(\mathbf{F}(x, y) = P(x, y)\mathbf{i} + Q(x, y)\mathbf{j}\) has a z-component given by:
\[
\text{Curl}_z = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}.
\]

Here:
- \(P(x, y) = -1.4y + 1.1xy\),
- \(Q(x, y) = 1.4x - 1.1x^2\).

### Step 1: Partial derivative \(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}\)
\[
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( 1.4x - 1.1x^2 \right) = 1.4 - 2.2x.
\]

At the origin \((x, y) = (0, 0)\):
\[
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} = 1.4 - 2.2(0) = 1.4.
\]

### Step 2: Partial derivative \(\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\)
\[
\frac{\partial P}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( -1.4y + 1.1xy \right) = -1.4 + 1.1x.
\]

At the origin \((x, y) = (0, 0)\):
\[
\frac{\partial P}{\partial y} = -1.4 + 1.1(0) = -1.4.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(\text{Curl}_z\)
\[
\text{Curl}_z = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} = 1.4 - (-1.4) = 1.4 + 1.4 = 2.8.

Indicate your choice as a single letter (e.g., M). If none of them are realistic, return None.",C,physical_reasoning,"Based on the question and the visual clips provided:

The scenario involves a **30lb kettlebell** and a **green piece of paper** being carefully lowered onto two pillows. To determine the most realistic physics behavior, we would need to inspect how the objects interact:

1. The kettlebell, being heavy, should compress the pillows significantly and create visible deformation as it sinks into them.
2. The green piece of paper, being light, should rest on the surface without affecting the pillows noticeably.
3. The motion and reaction of the pillows should appear natural, with no abrupt or unrealistic behavior such as extreme bouncing or lack of compression under weight.

However, the series of clips show varying levels of realistic and unrealistic interactions between the objects and the pillows:

- **Most clips exhibit unnatural behavior**, such as the pillows not deforming enough under the heavy kettlebell or the green paper behaving unrealistically. 
- Without clear deformation of the pillows proportionate to the weight, none of the examples might truly replicate authentic physics.

30,physical_reasoning_physics_MarkLeviProof_MarkLeviProofExplorerQ1.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,"A bead slides downward along a cycloidal track. Let a be the magnitude of its acceleration at some arbitrary point. Which relationship is correct?
(Hint: because the radius of curvature is small, a centripetal‐acceleration term is added.)
(A) a = g \sin\theta
(B) a > g \sin\theta
(C) a < g \sin\theta
(D) a = g (constant)
",B,physical_reasoning,"The correct answer is:

**(B) \( a > g \sin \theta \)**.

### Explanation:
In this scenario, a bead slides along a **cycloidal track**. The key hint in the question is that ""because the radius of curvature is small, a centripetal-acceleration term is added.""

---

When an object moves along a curved path, its total acceleration has two components:
1. **Tangential acceleration**, which is related to gravity, is \( g \sin \theta \) (from the projection of gravitational force along the slope at an angle \( \theta \)).
2. **Centripetal acceleration**, which arises due to the curvature of the track.

Since the radius of curvature of the cycloidal path is small, the centripetal acceleration component (related to \( v^2 / R \), where \( R \) is the radius of curvature) is non-negligible. Therefore, the **total acceleration \( a \)** exceeds just the tangential acceleration \( g \sin \theta \). 

This makes the relationship:
\[
a > g \sin \theta
\] 

Hence, option **B** is the correct choice."

Output only the letter of the correct answer,C,mathematical_reasoning,"To find the z-component of the curl at the green point, we use the formula for the curl in 2D:

\[
\text{Curl}(F) = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial M}{\partial y}
\]

where \( \mathbf{F}(x, y) = M \mathbf{i} + N \mathbf{j} \):
- \( M = -0.8y + 1.4xy \)
- \( N = 0.8x - 1.4x^2 \)

### Step 1: Differentiate \( N \) with respect to \( x \):
\[
\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(0.8x - 1.4x^2) = 0.8 - 2.8x
\]

### Step 2: Differentiate \( M \) with respect to \( y \):
\[
\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(-0.8y + 1.4xy) = -0.8 + 1.4x
\]

### Step 3: Compute the curl:
\[
\text{Curl}(F) = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = (0.8 - 2.8x) - (-0.8 + 1.4x)
\]
Simplify:
\[
\text{Curl}(F) = 0.8 - 2.8x + 0.8 - 1.4x = 1.6 - 4.2x
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate at the green point:
From the plot, the green point appears to be at \((x, y) = (0, 0)\).

Substitute \( x = 0 \):
\[
\text{Curl}(F) = 1.6 - 4.2(0) = 1.6

(D) The number of slits has no effect on pattern position.",C,physical_reasoning,"The correct answer is:

**(C) Fewer slits increase fringe spacing and remove secondary minima.**

Explanation:
When the number of slits is reduced, the interference pattern changes significantly. With fewer slits (e.g., 2 slits), the pattern becomes less dependent on multiple-slit interference effects, so the spacing between the bright fringes (principal maxima) increases, and secondary minima are no longer as prominent. This explains the broader and sparser pattern when the number of slits is reduced."

From reviewing the given sequences:
1. The kettlebell is a massive and stationary object (30 lb is very heavy compared to a tennis ball).
2. Physics dictates that when a tennis ball makes contact with such a massive object, the ball would either bounce back, deform (depending on its elasticity), or stop. The kettlebell will not move significantly due to its large mass relative to the ball.

- Some depict the kettlebell moving — this violates the principles of physics.

Output the answer rounded to 2 decimal places.,1.01,mathematical_reasoning,"To find the definite integral using the **Midpoint Riemann Sum**, follow these steps:

1. **Function and Interval Details**:
   - Function provided: \( f(x) = \ln(x+1) e^{-x/3} \)
   - Interval: \( [2, 4] \)
   - Number of Rectangles = 6

2. **Step Size (\( \Delta x \))**:
   \[
   \Delta x = \frac{b - a}{n} = \frac{4 - 2}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = 0.3333\ \text{(rounded to 4 decimals)}
   \]

3. **Midpoints for Each Interval**:
   Calculate the midpoints of each subinterval:
   - Subintervals split the interval \( [2, 4] \) into six equal parts. Starting points: \( 2, 2.333, 2.667, 3, 3.333, 3.667 \), and their midpoints are:
     \[
     m_1 = 2.1667,\ m_2 = 2.5,\ m_3 = 2.8333,\ m_4 = 3.1667,\ m_5 = 3.5,\ m_6 = 3.8333
     \]

4. **Evaluate \( f(x) \) at Each Midpoint**:
   Using the given function \( f(x) = \ln(x+1) e^{-x/3} \):
   \[
   f(m_1) = \ln(2.1667 + 1) \cdot e^{-2.1667/3},\ \dots,\ \text{repeat for } m_2 \text{ through } m_6
   \]

   After evaluating (use a calculator or software):
   - \( f(m_1) \approx 0.56 \)
   - \( f(m_2) \approx 0.54 \)
   - \( f(m_3) \approx 0.52 \)
   - \( f(m_4) \approx 0.50 \)
   - \( f(m_5) \approx 0.47 \)
   - \( f(m_6) \approx 0.44 \)

5. **Calculate the Midpoint Riemann Sum**:
   Multiply each function value by \( \Delta x \) and sum them up:
   \[
   \text{Area} \approx \Delta x \cdot \left( f(m_1) + f(m_2) + f(m_3) + f(m_4) + f(m_5) + f(m_6) \right)
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   \text{Area} \approx 0.3333 \cdot (0.56 + 0.54 + 0.52 + 0.50 + 0.47 + 0.44)
   \]
   Sum the function values:
   \[
   0.56 + 0.54 + 0.52 + 0.50 + 0.47 + 0.44 = 3.03
   \]
   Multiply by \( \Delta x \):
   \[
   \text{Area} \approx 0.3333 \cdot 3.03 \approx 1.01
   \]

The definite integral using the Midpoint Riemann Sum is approximately:

(A) T_{\text{Diff}} becomes larger because the straight path shortens more slowly.

**(B) \( T_{Diff} \) approaches zero because both paths become nearly horizontal.**

Explanation:

As point \( B \) is moved closer to \( A \), the vertical drop decreases. For both the linear path (\( T_{Line} \)) and the cycloidal path (\( T_{Cyc} \)), the difference in time (\( T_{Diff} = T_{Line} - T_{Cyc} \)) becomes smaller because the time taken along both paths converges to nearly the same value.

   Newton's method approximates roots using:  
   \[
   x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}

2. **Iterate 7 Times:**

3. **Round the Result:**
   The result after 7 steps needs to be rounded to **2 decimal places**.

### **Required Information Missing: Polynomial \( f(x) \)**
From the video images, the graph represents a degree 3 polynomial, but the explicit function \( f(x) \) and its derivative \( f'(x) \) are not provided in the media or the question frame.

Without the explicit equations, it's not possible to numerically compute the exact approximation. However, based on Newton’s method, each iteration draws closer to the actual root or zero of \( f(x) \). For a well-behaved polynomial, after 7 steps, it typically converges to the root with high precision.

---

To compute the solution:
- Retrieve the exact polynomial equation \( f(x) \) and its derivative \( f'(x) \).
- Use the Newton's method formula iteratively starting from \( x_0 = 4.0 \).
- Round the 7th approximation \( x_7 \) to 2 decimal places.

From the clips observed earlier, which one demonstrates scientifically accurate physics for the scene above?
Select one letter (e.g., H). If none of them are realistic, return None.",B,physical_reasoning,"To determine which clip demonstrates scientifically accurate physics for the described scene, let me break it down:

- **Setup Description**: A blue block is carefully placed on top of a yellow block that is balanced on a red block, forming an ""L"" shape. This configuration's stability depends on the center of mass of the system staying above the red block.

- **Key Physical Considerations**:  
  - The **center of mass** must stay within the base of support (red block) for the structure to remain balanced.  
  - If the blue block is positioned such that the yellow block's weight and the blue block's weight shift the center of mass outside the red block's footprint, the entire structure will topple.

By carefully observing each clip:  

- In the **scientifically accurate clip**, the structure behaves correctly according to the laws of physics—i.e., it should remain balanced if the center of mass stays over the red block, or topple if the placement causes the center of mass to shift outside the red block.  

If none of the clips depict this behavior realistically, the answer should be **None**.  

Upon reviewing the frames, Clip **F** shows the structure remaining stable, which appears to align with realistic physics (assuming the center of mass stays balanced). If Clip F does not meet criteria upon real observation, return **None**."

Choose the graph that best describe the motion of the two objects",D,physical_reasoning,"To determine the correct motion paths of the particles in the magnetic field, we apply the principles of motion in a magnetic field:

### Key Points:
1. **Charged particles in a magnetic field follow circular or helical trajectories, depending on the angle between their velocity and the magnetic field**:
   - In this problem, we assume the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field (based on available information).
   
2. **Force Direction**:
   - The magnetic force on a charged particle is given by:  
     \(\vec{F} = q (\vec{v} \times \vec{B})\).  
     Using the **right-hand rule**, the force direction depends on the charge of the particle:
       - A **positive charge** bends in one direction.
       - A **negative charge** bends in the opposite direction.

3. **Path Radius**:
   - The radius of the circular path is determined by:  
     \[
     r = \frac{m v}{|q| B}
     \]
     where:
     - \(m\) is the mass of the particle,
     - \(v\) is the velocity magnitude,
     - \(q\) is the charge,
     - \(B\) is the magnetic field magnitude.

     Thus:
     - A larger mass or smaller charge leads to a **larger path radius**.
     - A particle with a greater charge bends **more sharply**.

---

### Given:
- **Blue particle** (\(q = -1.7, m = 0.9\)):  
  Negative charge → bends in one direction (via the right-hand rule).
  
- **Red particle** (\(q = 0.6, m = 1.9\)):  
  Positive charge → bends in the opposite direction.

- Magnetic Field:  
  \(\vec{B} = -1.8 \hat{k}\), pointing into the screen.

---

### Analyzing the Options:
#### Option A:
   - Both paths are straight.  
     **Incorrect**: Charged particles in a magnetic field do not follow straight-line paths.

#### Option B:
   - Neither particle curves.
     **Incorrect**: Same reasoning as Option A.

#### Option C:
   - The blue particle bends clockwise (due to its negative charge), and the red particle bends counterclockwise (due to its positive charge).  
     **Correct**: This agrees with the physics of the scenario.

#### Option D:
   - The particles bend in opposite directions, but the radii and directions look reversed.  
     **Incorrect**: The motion paths are inconsistent with the charge and mass values.

A\,(0.0,\;1.5)\,\text{m} to point
B\,(4.0,\;-1.5)\,\text{m} along a straight track.
Which expression correctly gives the travel time T_{\text{Line}} in a uniform gravitational field g?
(A) T_{\text{Line}} = \sqrt{2} \,\frac{L}{\sqrt{g\,h}}
(B) T_{\text{Line}} = \frac{L}{\sqrt{2g\,h}}
(C) T_{\text{Line}} = \sqrt{\frac{L}{2g\,h}}
(D) T_{\text{Line}} = \sqrt{g} \,\frac{L}{\sqrt{2h}}",B,physical_reasoning,"To solve the problem and determine which expression for \( T_{\text{line}} \) is correct, let's break it down.

### Given:

- A bead slides without friction from point \( A(0, 1.5) \) to point \( B(4.0, -1.5) \) in a uniform gravitational field (\( g = 9.80 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)).
- The bead travels along a **straight track**.

### Key points:
The travel time \( T_{\text{line}} \) depends on:
1. The effective acceleration due to gravity (component along the straight track).
2. The length of the straight track \( L \).
3. The height difference (\( h \)) between \( A \) and \( B \).

---

### Step 1: Length of the track \( L \)
The straight track \( AB \) forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The coordinates give:
\[
L = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = \sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (-1.5 - 1.5)^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \, \text{m}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Height difference (\( h \))
The vertical height difference \( h \) is:
\[
h = |y_1 - y_2| = |1.5 - (-1.5)| = |1.5 + 1.5| = 3 \, \text{m}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Acceleration along the track
In a uniform gravitational field, only the component of gravity along the incline affects motion. The effective acceleration along the incline is:
\[
a = g \sin \theta,
\]
where \( \sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{h}{L} \). Thus:
\[
a = g \frac{h}{L}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Travel time along the straight track
The time for an object to slide down a straight frictionless incline is given by:
\[
T_{\text{line}} = \sqrt{\frac{2L}{a}}.
\]
Substitute \( a = g \frac{h}{L} \):
\[
T_{\text{line}} = \sqrt{\frac{2L}{g \frac{h}{L}}} = \sqrt{\frac{2L^2}{gh}}.
\]

Simplify:
\[
T_{\text{line}} = \frac{L}{\sqrt{gh/2}} = \frac{L}{\sqrt{2gh}}.
\]

---

### Correct Answer:
The expression that matches is:
\[
\boxed{\text{(B)} \, T_{\text{line}} = \frac{L}{\sqrt{2gh}}}.

Choose the graph that best describe the motion of the two objects",D,physical_reasoning,"To determine which set of paths best represents the motion of the charged particles in the magnetic field, we analyze the given setups and understand the forces involved:

1. **Given Information**:
    - Particle 1 (red): Charge \( q = 0.5 \), mass \( m = 2.5 \).
    - Particle 2 (blue): Charge \( q = -1.3 \), mass \( m = 2.5 \).
    - Magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} = -2.2 \hat{k} \) (points into the page).

2. **Force on a Charged Particle in Magnetic Field**:
    The Lorentz force is given by:
    \[
    \mathbf{F} = q (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
    \]
    - The force direction depends on the charge \( q \), velocity \( \mathbf{v} \), and magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} \).

3. **Path of the Particles**:
    - The direction of motion will curve because the Lorentz force causes the charged particle to move in a circular or helical path.
    - Positive charges curve in one direction, and negative charges curve the opposite way.

4. **Analysis of the Given Options**:
    - **Positive charge curves differently than the negative charge.**
    - The mass of both particles is identical, so their circular paths will generally depend on the magnitude of their charges and velocities.

Choose the graph that best describe the position of the object after fall",A,physical_reasoning,"To determine which graph best represents the vertical velocity \(v_y(t)\) for an object falling in a viscous fluid, we can analyze the physical situation. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Forces Acting on the Object:**
   - Gravity pulls the object down: \( F_g = m \cdot g \).
   - A buoyant force opposes gravity: \( F_b = \rho_{\text{fluid}} \cdot V \cdot g \).
   - There's a drag force due to the fluid's viscosity: \( F_d = -b \cdot v \), proportional to the velocity.

2. **Terminal Velocity:**
   - At terminal velocity, the net force is zero:
     \[
     F_{\text{net}} = F_g - F_b - F_d = 0.
     \]
     This means the downward velocity \(v_y(t)\) will approach a constant value over time (terminal velocity).

3. **Velocity Behavior Over Time:**
   - Initially, gravity dominates, so the object accelerates.
   - As velocity increases, drag and buoyant forces grow.
   - The object eventually reaches terminal velocity and stops accelerating, resulting in a **flattened, horizontal asymptote** in the graph of \(v_y(t)\).

4. **Graph Shape:**
   - The vertical velocity \(v_y(t)\) starts at 0, increases rapidly at first, and then asymptotically approaches terminal velocity.

### Correct Graph:

Graph **B** best represents this behavior:
- It starts at \(v_y = 0\).
- It increases rapidly and then levels off, flattening as it approaches the terminal velocity.

- The object experiences **gravitational force**, **buoyant force**, and **viscous drag** (a force proportional to velocity).
- Initially, the object accelerates as gravity dominates. Over time, the object reaches **terminal velocity**, where drag and buoyant forces balance gravity, causing the velocity to asymptotically flatten at a constant value.

Use a single letter to respond (e.g., J). If none of them are realistic, return None.",A,physical_reasoning,"The question asks which of the examples aligns with the principles of physics in the described context.

Analyzing the context:

- A paper towel, when released into a dish of light blue liquid, should absorb some of the liquid due to capillary action.
- This absorption will likely cause either a spreading or soaking effect, depending on the physics of fluid dynamics and the interaction between liquid and paper towel.
- There should also be no unrealistic or unexplained physical behaviors, such as the towel floating unnaturally or being unaffected by the liquid.

After examining the sets of images where scenarios play out, **Set 8 is the most realistic** because it depicts the paper towel interacting with the liquid (absorbing it) and remaining consistent with the principles of physics.

1. **First Example**: Starting from a small red cross (+) in the center, the pattern expanded outward to form several layers in a grid-like spiral with red lines. Only red squares were a part of the resulting pattern.

2. **Second Example**: A red cross (+) generated a more complex grid-like pattern, but again included only red squares.

Now, in the final frame, the input is again a red cross (+), and we are asked to identify the *output count of dark red squares*. Based on the consistent rules shown for inputs and outputs, it is likely that the spiral pattern expands with dark red squares replicating the previous examples.

For an exact count, we would need to carefully examine the size or layers of the output grid. However, as the explicit size isn’t clear, I recommend applying the growth logic from prior outputs.

n \lambda = d \sin \theta
\]  

where:  
- \( n \): order of diffraction (here \( n = 1 \), for the first-order spot),
- \( \lambda \): wavelength of the red light,
- \( d \): spacing between the lines on the grating,
- \( \theta \): diffraction angle.

### Step 1: Given information
- Grating: 600 lines/mm → \( d = \frac{1}{600 \, \text{lines/mm}} = \frac{1}{600 \times 10^3 \, \text{lines/m}} = 1.67 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}\),
- Screen distance \( L = 1.00 \, \text{m} \),
- Offset of the red first-order spot: \( x = 0.345 \, \text{m} \),
- \( \tan \theta = \frac{x}{L} \), so \( \theta = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{0.345}{1.00} \right) \).

### Step 2: Calculate \( \theta \)  
\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}(0.345) \approx 19.1^\circ
\]  

### Step 3: Solve for \( \lambda \)  
Rearrange the grating equation for \( \lambda \):  
\[
\lambda = \frac{d \sin \theta}{n}
\]  

Substitute \( d = 1.67 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \), \( \theta \approx 19.1^\circ \), and \( n = 1 \):  
\[
\lambda = \left( 1.67 \times 10^{-6} \right) \sin(19.1^\circ)
\]  

\[
\sin(19.1^\circ) \approx 0.327
\]  

\[
\lambda \approx (1.67 \times 10^{-6}) \times 0.327 \approx 5.46 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} = 546 \, \text{nm}
\]  

### Step 4: Choose the closest answer

A. It halves.
B. It increases by a factor of √2.
C. It doubles.
D. It does not change.",C,physical_reasoning,"The correct answer is **C. It doubles.**

### Explanation:

The fringe spacing in a diffraction pattern is determined by the equation:

\[
d \cdot \sin\theta = m \cdot \lambda
\]

Where:
- \( d \) is the slit spacing (the inverse of the line density),
- \( \theta \) is the diffraction angle,
- \( m \) is the order of the fringe (for the first-order fringe, \( m = 1 \)),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light.

When the line density is decreased from 800 lines/mm to 400 lines/mm, the spacing between slits, \( d \), doubles.

The distance \( x \) to the fringe on a screen at a fixed distance \( L \) is given by:

\[
x = L \cdot \tan\theta \approx L \cdot \sin\theta \quad \text{(for small angles)}.
\]

From the diffraction equation:

\[
\sin\theta = \frac{m \cdot \lambda}{d}.
\]

If \( d \) doubles, then \( \sin\theta \) (and hence \( \tan\theta \)) also doubles for the same \( m \) and \( \lambda \).

Thus, the horizontal distance \( x \) to the first-order fringe doubles."

(A) The minimization condition for the brachistochrone is independent of g.
(B) A larger g rescales both r and \theta_f equally, leaving the curve identical.
(C) Numerical sampling density is fixed, hiding any change.
(D) Air resistance exactly cancels the g dependence.",A,physical_reasoning,"The correct answer is:

**(A) The minimization condition for the brachistochrone is independent of g.**

Explanation: The brachistochrone problem is about finding the path of quickest descent of a particle under gravity, assuming no friction or air resistance. The shape of the cycloid is derived from mathematical principles that minimize the time of descent, and this minimization process is independent of the value of gravitational acceleration \( g \).

Approximately what will the first-order diffraction angle θ₁ (measured from the normal) be?
A. ≈ 10°
B. ≈ 20°
C. ≈ 30°
D. ≈ 40°",D,physical_reasoning,"To solve this problem, we use the diffraction grating equation:

\[
d (\sin \theta_i + \sin \theta_m) = m \lambda
\]

### Given:
- Number of lines per millimeter: \(600 \, \text{lines/mm}\), so the grating spacing is:
\[
d = \frac{1}{600 \ \text{lines/mm}} = 1.67 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{meters (m)}
\]
- Wavelength of laser: \(\lambda = 650 \, \text{nm} = 6.50 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\)
- Incident angle: \(\theta_i = 30^\circ\)
- Order \(m = 1\) (first-order diffraction)

We solve for the diffraction angle \(\theta_m\).

### Step 1: Substituting into the equation:
\[
1.67 \times 10^{-6} (\sin 30^\circ + \sin \theta_m) = 1 (6.50 \times 10^{-7})
\]

\[
1.67 \times 10^{-6} (0.5 + \sin \theta_m) = 6.50 \times 10^{-7}

### Step 2: Isolate \(\sin \theta_m\):
\[
0.5 + \sin \theta_m = \frac{6.50 \times 10^{-7}}{1.67 \times 10^{-6}}

Choose the graph that best describe the position of the object after fall",B,physical_reasoning,"The question asks which graph best represents the vertical velocity \( v_y(t) \) of an object falling in a viscous fluid. 

To deduce the correct answer, let’s analyze the falling object's behavior:

1. **Physics of the problem**: 
   - When an object falls through a viscous fluid, it first accelerates due to gravity. 
   - As it moves down, drag and buoyant forces oppose the motion. 
   - Over time, these opposing forces balance the gravitational force, and the object reaches **terminal velocity**. This means \( v_y(t) \) asymptotically approaches a constant value.

2. **Graph characteristics**:
   - The vertical velocity starts at \( 0 \) (object starts from rest) and increases over time, approaching a constant value (terminal velocity).

### Selecting the Graph:
- From the options (A, B, C, D):
  - **Graph B** shows an asymptotic approach to a constant terminal velocity. This matches the described physical behavior.
  - Graphs A and C are linear, implying constant acceleration or constant deceleration, which do not fit this scenario.
  - Graph D's curve decreases rapidly and does not seem to match the object settling into terminal velocity.

The direction of their motion is influenced by the Lorentz force, which acts perpendicular to their velocity and the magnetic field. Let's break down how to approach this:

1. **Key Parameters:**
   - **Particle 1:** Charge \( q = -1.4 \), Mass \( m = 1.4 \)
   - **Particle 2:** Charge \( q = -1.2 \), Mass \( m = 2.4 \)
   - Magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} = -0.6 \hat{k} \)

2. **Motion in a Magnetic Field:**
   - The Lorentz force causes the particles to move in circular or helical paths.
   - The **radius** of the circular path is proportional to \( \frac{mv}{|qB|} \).
   - The frequency of the circular motion \( \omega = \frac{|q|B}{m} \).

3. **Analysis of the Particles:**
   - Both particles have negative charges, so the force will deflect their paths in the same general curved direction but with different radii and angular speeds due to their different charge-to-mass ratios (\( |q|/m \)).
   - Particle 1 (\( q = -1.4, m = 1.4 \)): \( |q|/m = 1.0 \)
   - Particle 2 (\( q = -1.2, m = 2.4 \)): \( |q|/m = 0.5 \)

4. **Expected Paths:**
   - Since Particle 1 has a higher \( |q|/m \) ratio, it will experience a stronger deflection (smaller radius of curvature).
   - Particle 2, with a lower \( |q|/m \) ratio, will have a larger radius of curvature.

5. **Correct Path (Based on Options):**
   - The best representation of the motion is **Path C**:
     - Particle 1 has a smaller-radius curve.
     - Particle 2 has a larger-radius curve.

### Thus, **the answer is Path C**."
278,physical_reasoning_physics_MarkLeviProof_MarkLeviProofExplorerQ5.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,"A bead released from height h travels down a cycloidal path. At the point where its speed is v, the angle is \theta. For a bead that reaches the same speed v on a straight ramp, the angle is \theta{\prime}. Which statement is correct?
(A) \theta{\prime} < \theta
(B) \theta{\prime} = \theta
(C) \theta{\prime} > \theta
(D) The angles are independent of path shape",C,physical_reasoning,"The correct answer is:

**(A) θ' < θ**

### Explanation:
A bead traveling down a cycloidal path will achieve a steeper descent for the same speed compared to a bead traveling down a straight ramp. This is because the cycloidal path is shaped to minimize travel time (it's a brachistochrone curve), resulting in a steeper angle at any given point compared to the straight ramp. Thus, the angle θ’ (on the straight ramp) will be smaller than θ (on the cycloidal path)."

**""What is the approximation after 4 steps of Newton's method of this degree 4 polynomial? (Rounded to 2 decimal places, starting at the red dot).""**

To fully answer this question, you would need the function of the degree 4 polynomial used in the graph and the results of iterative calculations following **Newton's method**. However, based on the visuals provided, the following steps can help:

1. **Initial guess (red dot):** The initial guess \(x_0 = 2.0\).
2. **Iterations using Newton's Method:** Newton's method formula is:
   \[
   x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}

Choose the graph that best describe the displacement of the object",C,physical_reasoning,"The problem provides information for a damped harmonic oscillator with the following values:

- \( m = 1.71 \) (mass)
- \( k = 7.25 \) (spring constant)
- \( b = 1.63 \) (damping coefficient)
- Initial conditions: \( x(0) = -0.44 \) and \( v(0) = 2.47 \).

The task is to determine which of the graphs (A, B, C, or D) best represents the position \( x(t) \) over time for the oscillator.

### Analysis Based on Damped Harmonic Oscillator Dynamics:
1. A damped harmonic oscillator shows oscillations that gradually decrease in amplitude due to the effect of damping. This behavior is described by the equation:
   \[ m\ddot{x} + b\dot{x} + kx = 0 \]

2. For the given damping coefficient \( b = 1.63 \), the motion is likely **underdamped**, meaning the system will oscillate but with an exponentially decaying amplitude.

3. With an initial position \( x(0) = -0.44 \) and a positive initial velocity \( v(0) = 2.47 \), the system will likely start with a positive displacement after some decay in the negative direction.

### Matching the Graph Behavior:
- **Graph A:** Shows oscillations with decreasing amplitude, consistent with the described damped behavior, and the initial conditions match \( x(0) = -0.44 \) and \( v(0) > 0 \).
- **Graph B:** Does not seem to display oscillatory behavior; it appears to decay monotonically, which does not match the expected underdamped oscillations.
- **Graph C:** Begins at the wrong initial point, \( x(0) \neq -0.44 \).
- **Graph D:** Shows purely sinusoidal behavior with no decay, which does not match the damping described by \( b = 1.63 \).

### Correct Answer:
**Graph A** best represents the position \( x(t) \)."

Output the answer rounded to 2 decimal places.,7.6,mathematical_reasoning,"To calculate the **Midpoint Riemann Sum**, we need the function \(f(x) = 2\sin(x) + 3\), the interval \([2, 5]\), and the number of rectangles \(n = 4\).

### Step 1: Calculate the width (\(\Delta x\)) of each rectangle
\[
\Delta x = \frac{b - a}{n} = \frac{5 - 2}{4} = 0.75
\]

### Step 2: Determine the midpoints for the intervals
The midpoints (\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\)) are:
\[
x_1 = 2 + \frac{\Delta x}{2} = 2.375,\quad x_2 = 2.375 + 0.75 = 3.125,\quad x_3 = 3.875,\quad x_4 = 4.625
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate \(f(x)\) at each midpoint
\[
f(x) = 2\sin(x) + 3
\]
- At \(x_1 = 2.375\): \(f(2.375) = 2\sin(2.375) + 3 \approx 4.39\)
- At \(x_2 = 3.125\): \(f(3.125) = 2\sin(3.125) + 3 \approx 3.03\)
- At \(x_3 = 3.875\): \(f(3.875) = 2\sin(3.875) + 3 \approx 1.66\)
- At \(x_4 = 4.625\): \(f(4.625) = 2\sin(4.625) + 3 \approx 1.01\)

### Step 4: Compute the Riemann Sum
The Midpoint Riemann Sum is given by:
\[
\text{Sum} = \Delta x \cdot \left[f(x_1) + f(x_2) + f(x_3) + f(x_4)\right]
\]
\[
\text{Sum} = 0.75 \cdot \left[4.39 + 3.03 + 1.66 + 1.01\right]
\]
\[
\text{Sum} = 0.75 \cdot 10.09 = 7.5675
\]

### Step 5: Round to two decimal places
\[
\text{Sum} \approx 7.57
\]

### Final Answer:
The definite integral using the Midpoint Riemann Sum is approximately **7.57**."

### Answer:

Explanation:
From the simulation, objects moving along the **Straight** path retain the largest remaining potential energy at time \( t = 0.30 \), as they experience the slowest conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy compared to the other tracks (Parabola or Cycloid).

To solve this, we need:
1. **The function**: This is the degree 3 polynomial shown in the graph.
2. **The starting point**: The red dot, which is \( x_0 = -2.0 \).
3. **Apply Newton's method recursively** 6 times:

   x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)},
   \]
   where \( f(x) \) is the polynomial and \( f'(x) \) is its derivative.

Since the video provides a visual representation rather than the explicit function, continue to follow the steps visually. The approximations from the graph reveal the sequence \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_6 \). Extract the final approximate value and round it to 2 decimal places.

Output only the letter of the correct answer,B,mathematical_reasoning,"To solve the problem and determine the z-component of the curl \( \mathbf{F}(x, y) = (-1.0y + 0.6xy)\mathbf{i} + (1.0x - 0.6x^2)\mathbf{j} \) at the given green point (let's name it \((x_0, y_0)\)), we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Curl Formula
The z-component of the curl \( \mathbf{F} \) in 2D is given by:
\[
\text{curl}_z(\mathbf{F}) = \frac{\partial F_j}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_i}{\partial y}
\]
where:
- \( F_i = -1.0y + 0.6xy \)
- \( F_j = 1.0x - 0.6x^2 \)

### Step 2: Partial Derivatives
Compute the partial derivatives of \( F_i \) and \( F_j \):
1. \( \frac{\partial F_j}{\partial x} \):
\[
F_j = 1.0x - 0.6x^2 \implies \frac{\partial F_j}{\partial x} = 1.0 - 1.2x
\]

2. \( \frac{\partial F_i}{\partial y} \):
\[
F_i = -1.0y + 0.6xy \implies \frac{\partial F_i}{\partial y} = -1.0 + 0.6x
\]

### Step 3: Compute Curl at the Green Point
The curl is given by:
\[
\text{curl}_z = \frac{\partial F_j}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_i}{\partial y}
\]
Substitute the partial derivatives:
\[
\text{curl}_z = (1.0 - 1.2x) - (-1.0 + 0.6x)
\]
Simplify:
\[
\text{curl}_z = 1.0 - 1.2x + 1.0 - 0.6x = 2.0 - 1.8x
\]

Now, at the green point shown in the video, the coordinates \( (x_0, y_0) \) are likely \( (2.0, 1.0) \).

Substitute \( x = 2.0 \):
\[
\text{curl}_z = 2.0 - 1.8(2.0) = 2.0 - 3.6 = -1.6
\]

### Step 4: Choose the Correct Answer
It seems there was a slight misalignment in earlier visual steps. If the curl described resolves numerical flaws.

Analogously, in the brachistochrone problem, the bead's speed \( v \) is determined by the potential energy and hence the height of the bead. As \( n \) increases, the light speed \( c/n \) decreases—corresponding to the bead's speed \( v \) also decreasing in its respective physical system."

What is the approximate phase delay \Delta\phi (in radians)? (Use 2\pi \approx 6.28.)
(A) 2.90 \times 10^{4}
(B) 1.45 \times 10^{4}
(C) 4.83 \times 10^{3}
(D) 9.66 \times 10^{2}",C,physical_reasoning,"To calculate the approximate phase delay \(\Delta \phi\) in radians for the given scenario, we can use the formula:  

\[
\Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi d (n - 1)}{\lambda_0}
\]

where:
- \(d = 2.0 \, \text{mm} = 2.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}\) (thickness of the glass plate),
- \(n = 1.50\) (refractive index of the glass),
- \(\lambda_0 = 650 \, \text{nm} = 650 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\) (wavelength in vacuum).

### Step 1: Substitute the values into the formula:
\[
\Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi (2.0 \times 10^{-3})(1.50 - 1)}{650 \times 10^{-9}}
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the terms:
- \(n - 1 = 1.50 - 1 = 0.50\),
- \((2.0 \times 10^{-3})(0.50) = 1.0 \times 10^{-3}\),
- \(\lambda_0 = 650 \times 10^{-9} = 6.50 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\).

Now:
\[
\Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi (1.0 \times 10^{-3})}{6.50 \times 10^{-7}}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the ratio:
\[
\frac{1.0 \times 10^{-3}}{6.50 \times 10^{-7}} = \frac{1.0}{6.50} \times 10^{4} \approx 0.1538 \times 10^{4} = 1.538 \times 10^{3}.
\]

Now multiply by \(2\pi \approx 6.28\):
\[
\Delta \phi \approx 6.28 \times 1.538 \times 10^{3} \approx 9.65 \times 10^{3} \, \text{radians}.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{9.65 \times 10^{3}} \, \text{radians (D)}.

374,physical_reasoning_physics_EnergyConservation_EnergyConservationVisQ2.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,"Under the same condition as before (same arc length s = 1.0), which track shows the largest magnitude of kinetic energy (KE)?
(A) Straight
(B) Parabola
(C) Cycloid
(D) All the same",C,physical_reasoning,"The correct answer is **(D) All the same**.

### Explanation:
The principle of conservation of energy states that the total mechanical energy (TME), which is the sum of potential energy (PE) and kinetic energy (KE), remains constant in the absence of non-conservative forces. Since the scenario does not introduce air resistance or friction, the total energy remains conserved.

Regardless of the path taken (straight line, parabola, or cycloid), the heights at points A and B are the same. Therefore, the change in potential energy (PE) is identical for every path, leading to the same final kinetic energy (KE) at point B. Consequently, the magnitude of KE is the same for all paths."

#### 2. First Iteration (\( x_1 \)):
From the graph:
- Tangent starting from \( x_0 = -3.0 \) intersects the \( x \)-axis near \( x_1 = -3.45 \).

#### 3. Second Iteration (\( x_2 \)):
From the graph:
- Tangent starting from \( x_1 \approx -3.45 \) intersects the \( x \)-axis at \( x_2 \approx -3.48 \).

Output only the number, round to 2 decimal places",0.00,mathematical_reasoning,"To answer the question ""What is the flux through the surface?"" we need to compute the flux of the vector field **F(x, y) = sin(1.0y) i + cos(1.0x) j** through the boundary of the circular region shown in the video. According to **Gauss's theorem** or **divergence theorem**, we calculate the flux by integrating the divergence of F over the circular region in question.

### Steps:
1. **Divergence calculation**:  
   The divergence of the vector field F(x, y) is calculated as:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot F = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}[ \sin(1.0y) ] + \frac{\partial}{\partial y} [ \cos(1.0x) ].
   \]  
   Since \( \sin(1.0y) \) does not depend on \(x\), and \( \cos(1.0x) \) does not depend on \(y\):  
   \[
   \nabla \cdot F = 0 + 0 = 0.
   \]

2. **Implication of divergence being zero**:  
   If the divergence of the vector field is 0, then the net flux through any closed region (in this case, the circular region) is 0. This is because the flux is directly related to the integral of the divergence over the area enclosed by the surface.

### Final Answer:
The net flux through the surface is:

### Problem:
**Find the difference between the sum of the sequence that appeared after the third pause and the one before the first pause. Round the answer to two decimal places.**

---

### Step 1: Identify the sequences.

1. **Sequence before the first pause:**
   - The first number shown is `1`.
   - The second number is `212.41`.
   - Sequence before the first pause = `[1, 212.41]`.

2. **Sequence after the third pause:**
   - After the third pause, the sequence begins with `49` and `105.87`.
   - Sequence after the third pause = `[49, 105.87]`.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the sums.

1. **Sum of the sequence before the first pause:**
   \[
   1 + 212.41 = 213.41
   \]

2. **Sum of the sequence after the third pause:**
   \[
   49 + 105.87 = 154.87

---

### Step 3: Calculate the difference.

Output the answer rounded to 2 decimal places.,23.41,mathematical_reasoning,"To find the definite integral of the function \( f(x) = \log(x+1) \cdot x \) between the endpoints shown, we need the integral bounds. Assuming the shaded area corresponds to the range \( a \leq x \leq b \), let’s evaluate the definite integral:

\[
\int_a^b \log(x+1) \cdot x \, dx 
\]

### Steps:
1. Set up the integral: substitute for \( a \) and \( b \) the numerical bounds from the graph.
2. Use an appropriate numerical or computational method to evaluate the integral.
3. Round the result to 2 decimal places.

Unfortunately, I cannot directly deduce the bounds \( a \) and \( b \) or compute this integral without specific numerical data (e.g., coordinates of the endpoints).

(A) T_{\text{Line}} doubles, T_{\text{Cyc}} doubles
(B) T_{\text{Line}} quadruples, T_{\text{Cyc}} doubles
(C) T_{\text{Line}} doubles, T_{\text{Cyc}} quadruples
(D) Both times remain unchanged",B,physical_reasoning,"The question is about how travel times \( T_{\text{line}} \) (linear path) and \( T_{\text{cyc}} \) (cyclic path) change when gravity \( g \) is reduced to \( \frac{g}{4} \).

### Key Understanding:
- **Travel Time Relation to Gravity**:
  - For free-falling objects (or objects in motion under gravity), the time to traverse a path is inversely proportional to the square root of gravity, \( t \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{g}} \).

- Reducing gravity to \( \frac{g}{4} \):
  \[
  t_{\text{new}} = t_{\text{original}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{g}{\frac{g}{4}}} = t_{\text{original}} \cdot 2
  \]
  Hence, travel times for both \( T_{\text{line}} \) and \( T_{\text{cyc}} \) will **double**.

### Correct Answer:
**(A) \( T_{\text{line}} \) doubles, \( T_{\text{cyc}} \) doubles.**"

(A) It moves closer to the center.""
(B) It moves farther from the center."",
(C) It stays in the same place.""
(D) Only its brightness changes; the position stays the same.""",A,physical_reasoning,"The correct answer is:

**(B) It moves farther from the center.**

### Explanation:
In a diffraction or interference pattern, the position of the fringes (including the first-order fringe) is determined by the equation:

\[
d \sin \theta = m \lambda
\]

Where:
- \(d\) = slit spacing (distance between adjacent slits),
- \(\theta\) = angle of the diffraction fringe,
- \(m\) = order of the fringe (\(m=1\) for the first-order fringe),
- \(\lambda\) = wavelength of the light.

If \(d\) is **increased (slit spacing becomes larger, corresponding to decreasing ""Lines per mm""),** the angle \(\theta\) for a given \(m\) would increase to satisfy the equation. This means the first-order fringe (\(m=1\)) moves **farther from the center.**"

",0.77,physical_reasoning,"To calculate the ratio of the angular frequencies \(\frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2}\):

Angular frequency (\(\omega\)) is inversely proportional to the period (\(T\)) of the oscillation. If we can observe the relative periods of the two oscillators (System 1 and System 2) in the video, we can use the relation:

\[
\frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2} = \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

1. Observe the video and count the number of full oscillation cycles completed by each system over a fixed timeframe.
2. Compute the period of each oscillator (e.g., if one completes 2 cycles in the time it takes for the other to complete 1 cycle, then their periods are \(T_1\) = 1 unit time and \(T_2\) = 0.5 unit time, respectively).

What is the surface area of the figure assuming all sides are 1 unit? Answer with a single integer.,188,spatial_reasoning,"The video demonstrates a colorful 3D structure composed of unit cubes. Based on the challenge to calculate the **surface area of the figure**, we need to count the visible square faces of the cubes forming the outer surface.

### How to solve:
1. **Understand the problem:** Surface area involves summing up all the outer faces that are exposed.
   - Each cube contributes 6 faces when isolated.
   - However, when cubes join together, their touching faces are hidden and do not count towards the surface area.
2. To compute the surface area:
   - Carefully observe the structure to account for all visible faces across the figure.

(A) It increases by 1.
(B) It remains unchanged.
(C) It decreases by 1.
(D) It decreases (approaches 1).",D,physical_reasoning,"The question asks: **""Assuming the wavelength is much larger than the plasma resonance frequency, if the free electron density is doubled, how does the refractive index \( n \) change?""**

### Key Concepts:
In the context of electromagnetics, the refractive index \( n \) is influenced by the material's dielectric properties, which depend on the free electron density \( N \). For wavelengths much larger than the plasma resonance frequency, the refractive index \( n \) can be approximated by the relation:

\[
n \approx \sqrt{1 - \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}}
\]

where:
- \( \omega_p \) is the plasma frequency, which depends on the free electron density \( N \),
  \[
  \omega_p = \sqrt{\frac{Ne^2}{\epsilon_0 m_e}}
  \]
- \( \omega \) is the angular frequency of the light wave.

When **\( N \)** doubles, \( \omega_p^2 \) also doubles (since \( \omega_p^2 \propto N \)). As a result, the term \( \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2} \) becomes larger.

For \( \omega_p^2 \ll \omega^2 \) (as specified in the question), \( n \) decreases and approaches 1 (the refractive index of free space).

### Correct Answer:
**(D) It decreases (approaches 1).**"

Output the answer rounded to 2 decimal places.,6.67,mathematical_reasoning,"To solve this, let's calculate the **Midpoint Riemann Sum** for the given function:

#### Function:  
\[ f(x) = 0.5x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x + 1 \]

#### Interval:
\[ [1, 3] \]

#### Subintervals:
4 rectangles. The width of each rectangle is:
\[
\Delta x = \frac{3 - 1}{4} = 0.5
\]

#### Midpoints
For each subinterval, the midpoint is calculated as the average of the left and right endpoints:
1. Subinterval: \([1, 1.5]\), midpoint = \(1.25\)
2. Subinterval: \([1.5, 2]\), midpoint = \(1.75\)
3. Subinterval: \([2, 2.5]\), midpoint = \(2.25\)
4. Subinterval: \([2.5, 3]\), midpoint = \(2.75\)

#### Function evaluations at midpoints
Let’s evaluate \( f(x) \) at each midpoint:
1. \( f(1.25) = 0.5(1.25)^3 - 2(1.25)^2 + 3(1.25) + 1 = 0.5(1.953125) - 2(1.5625) + 3.75 + 1 = 2.6015625 \)
2. \( f(1.75) = 0.5(1.75)^3 - 2(1.75)^2 + 3(1.75) + 1 = 0.5(5.359375) - 2(3.0625) + 5.25 + 1 = 2.80078125 \)
3. \( f(2.25) = 0.5(2.25)^3 - 2(2.25)^2 + 3(2.25) + 1 = 0.5(11.390625) - 2(5.0625) + 6.75 + 1 = 3.3203125 \)
4. \( f(2.75) = 0.5(2.75)^3 - 2(2.75)^2 + 3(2.75) + 1 = 0.5(20.796875) - 2(7.5625) + 8.25 + 1 = 4.5234375 \)

#### Midpoint Riemann Sum
Using the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \Delta x \cdot \sum f(\text{midpoints})
\]
\[
\text{Sum} = 0.5 \cdot \left[f(1.25) + f(1.75) + f(2.25) + f(2.75)\right]
\]
\[
\text{Sum} = 0.5 \cdot \left[2.6015625 + 2.80078125 + 3.3203125 + 4.5234375\right]
\]
\[
\text{Sum} = 0.5 \cdot 13.24609375 = 6.623046875
\]

#### Final Answer
The definite integral using the Midpoint Riemann Sum is approximately:
\[

Output the answer rounded to 2 decimal places.,12.7,mathematical_reasoning,"To calculate the **Left Riemann Sum** as shown in this video, we sum the areas of the rectangles approximating the integral. Based on the graph:

The x-intervals are given as `[2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8]` and the corresponding **Left Riemann heights** (y-values) are:  
- Height at \(x = 2.0\), \(y = 7.39\)  
- Height at \(x = 2.2\), \(y = 9.03\)  
- Height at \(x = 2.4\), \(y = 11.02\)  
- Height at \(x = 2.6\), \(y = 13.46\)

**Step 1**: Calculate the width of each rectangle:  
\( \Delta x = 2.2 - 2.0 = 0.2 \)

**Step 2**: Compute the areas of the rectangles:  
For the Left Riemann Sum, we use the y-values at the left endpoint of each subinterval:  
- Rectangle 1: \(0.2 \cdot 7.39 = 1.478\)  
- Rectangle 2: \(0.2 \cdot 9.03 = 1.806\)  
- Rectangle 3: \(0.2 \cdot 11.02 = 2.204\)  
- Rectangle 4: \(0.2 \cdot 13.46 = 2.692\)  

**Step 3**: Sum the areas:  
\[
\text{Total Area} = 1.478 + 1.806 + 2.204 + 2.692 = 8.18
