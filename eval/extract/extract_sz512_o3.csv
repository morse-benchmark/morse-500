69,physical_reasoning_physics_Diffraction_DiffractionGratingSimulatorQ3.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,C,C,physical_reasoning,"Correct choice:  

(C) Fewer slits increase fringe spacing and remove secondary minima.

Explanation  
For a grating the principal-maxima angles (d sin θ = mλ) depend only on the slit spacing d, not on how many slits N are open.  
However, as N rises the factor (sin Nβ / sin β)² introduces (N–2) secondary maxima between any two principal maxima, making the pattern dense. When N is suddenly cut to 2, those intermediate (secondary) peaks disappear, so the remaining bright fringes are farther apart and the pattern looks “sparse with wide spacing.” The principal-maxima width actually broadens (not narrows) when N is reduced, ruling out the other options.","Near the end of the video, when the number of slits is abruptly reduced to just two, the screen pattern becomes sparse with wide spacing. What does this best illustrate?
(A) Fewer slits make the principal maxima narrower.""
(B) Fewer slits reduce the beam’s overall spread.""
(C) Fewer slits increase fringe spacing and remove secondary minima.""

B points into the screen ( − k̂ ).

Blue particle  
q = −1.7, v to the right (+x)  
v × B points upward (+y); multiplying by the negative charge reverses it, so F is downward ( − y ).  
It therefore curves clockwise with a relatively tight radius (r ∝ m/|q|).

Red particle  
q = +0.6, v to the left (−x)  
v × B points downward ( − y ); with a positive charge the force stays downward.  
It also curves clockwise, but its radius is larger because m/|q| is larger.

So both paths bend downward (clockwise), with the blue path having the smaller radius of curvature and the red path the larger one.

141,physical_reasoning_physics_ParameterSensitivity_ParameterSensitivityAnalyzerQ1.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,B,A,physical_reasoning,"For motion down a straight, friction-free incline we can treat the component of gravity along the track as a constant acceleration  

a = g sin θ = g (h/L) ,

where  
• h is the vertical drop (h = 1.5 m – (–1.5 m) = 3.0 m) and  
• L is the length of the track (L = √(4² + 3²) = 5 m).

Starting from rest and traveling the distance L under constant acceleration a, we have  

L = ½ a T²  ⇒  T² = 2L/a = 2L /(g h/L) = 2L²/(g h).

Hence  

T = L √(2/(g h)) = (√2 L)/√(g h).

That expression corresponds to choice (A).","A bead slides without friction from point

For the brachistochrone problem the Euler-Lagrange equation that determines the curve contains the factor g in such a way that it cancels out; gravity only sets the overall time scale.

277,physical_reasoning_physics_emField_quiz_em_field_quiz_s788151_d6.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,C,C,physical_reasoning,"Both particles are negatively-charged and the magnetic field points into the page ( B = –0.6 k̂ ).  
For a velocity that lies in the plane of the page, the magnetic force is

F = q v × B .

Because q < 0, the force – and therefore the centre of the circular path – is 90° clockwise from the velocity vector.  
Hence each particle executes clockwise circular motion.

• Left particle: initial velocity is down-and-to-the-right ⇒ it curves further downward and then toward the left.  
• Right particle: initial velocity is to the left ⇒ it curves upward.

So the two trajectories bend away from one another – the left track bows downward, the right track bows upward – and neither path is straight.

Among the four sketches, only choice C shows two clockwise arcs that diverge in exactly this way.

278,physical_reasoning_physics_MarkLeviProof_MarkLeviProofExplorerQ5.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,C,A,physical_reasoning,"For the same change in height the bead on the cycloid moves **less** horizontal distance than the bead on a straight incline.  
Indeed, when the beads have the same speed  

  Δy = v²/(2 g)                                              (identical vertical drop)

the straight ramp has carried the bead a horizontal distance  

  Δx ′ = Δy / tan θ′ .

Because the cycloid is the brachistochrone, it reaches that same vertical drop in the **shortest possible time**, which is only possible if it also covers the **shortest horizontal distance**:  

  Δx < Δx ′ .

Hence  

  tan θ = Δy / Δx  >  Δy / Δx ′ = tan θ′ ,

so

  θ > θ′ .

Therefore the angle of the cycloid is always steeper than that of the straight ramp at the moment the two beads have the same speed.

Correct choice: (A)  θ′ < θ","A bead released from height h travels down a cycloidal path. At the point where its speed is v, the angle is \theta. For a bead that reaches the same speed v on a straight ramp, the angle is \theta{\prime}. Which statement is correct?

315,physical_reasoning_physics_dampedShm_quiz_shm_42_3.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,B,B,physical_reasoning,"The correct choice is graph B (the yellow curve).

Reasoning
1. The oscillator is under-damped  
   ζ = b ⁄ (2√(km)) = 1.59 ⁄ (2√(3.58·1.83)) ≈ 0.31 < 1,  
   so the motion must be an oscillation whose amplitude decays exponentially.

2. Initial conditions  
   x(0) = +0.99   (block is displaced to the right)  
   v(0) = +1.44   (block is moving farther to the right).  
   Therefore the graph must start above the axis and its initial slope must be positive.

3. Comparing with the four plots  
   • A – decaying oscillation but the initial slope is downward (wrong sign).  
   • B – decaying oscillation starting above zero with an upward (positive) initial slope (matches).  
   • C – undamped, constant-amplitude sinusoid (no decay).  
   • D – monotonic decay with almost no oscillation (over-/critically-damped).

Hence graph B best represents x(t).","

• Straight line:  The acceleration along the incline is a = g sin θ.  
  Time  T_line = √(2s/a) ∝ 1/√g ⇒ reducing g to g/4 multiplies the time by √(4)=2.

• Cycloid:  For a frictionless slide on a cycloidal brachistochrone the travel time is
 T_cyc = π√(R/g) (or the same √g–dependence for any segment), so T_cyc ∝ 1/√g.  
  Lowering g to g/4 likewise multiplies the time by 2.
