To determine how many cubes have exactly 3 faces exposed, we need to consider the positions of these cubes on the surface of the larger cube.

A 3x3x3 cube has 6 faces, and each face is a 3x3 grid of smaller cubes. The cubes that have exactly 3 faces exposed are those that are located at the corners of the larger cube. A cube has 8 corners, and each corner cube is exposed to all three faces of the larger cube.
