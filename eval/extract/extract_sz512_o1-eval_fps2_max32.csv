26,mathematical_reasoning_algebraic_reasoning_Integral_Methods_definite_integral_0.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,21.75,84.83,mathematical_reasoning,"A reasonable interpretation (based on the graph marking the last zero at \(x = 3\pi\)) is that the question asks for 
\[
\int_{0}^{3\pi} x^{2}\,\sin(x)\,dx.
\]
A straightforward way to compute this is via integration by parts twice.  One finds that an antiderivative is
\[
F(x) \;=\; -\,x^{2}\cos x \;+\; 2x\,\sin x \;+\; 2\,\cos x.
\]
Evaluating at the endpoints gives
\[
F(3\pi) \;-\; F(0) 
\;=\;\bigl[\,-\,9\pi^{2}\cos(3\pi)\;+\;0\;+\;2\cos(3\pi)\bigr]
\;-\;\bigl[\,0\;+\;0\;+\;2\cos(0)\bigr].
\]
Since \(\cos(3\pi)=-1\) and \(\cos(0)=1,\) this simplifies to
\[
9\pi^{2} - 2 \;-\; 2 
\;=\; 9\pi^{2} \;-\; 4.
\]
Numerically, \(9\pi^{2}-4 \approx 84.83,\) to two decimal places. Thus, the definite integral over the shown interval is

30,physical_reasoning_physics_MarkLeviProof_MarkLeviProofExplorerQ1.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,B,B,physical_reasoning,"A succinct way to see why the acceleration exceeds g sin θ is that **in addition** to the tangential component of gravity (which gives g sin θ), the bead has a sizable **normal (centripetal) component** of acceleration due to the cycloid’s tight curvature.

34,mathematical_reasoning_algebraic_reasoning_Euler_Method_euler_method_linear_1.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,B,B,mathematical_reasoning,"A succinct way to see why the result is around 1.73 is to note that the slope‐field in the video suggests the DE is

In puzzles like this, the usual logic is that each black cell in a colored region “expands” or is outlined by that region’s color in the output—but if black cells are adjacent, their outlines can overlap, which changes the final count.  Without being able to examine the grid cell‐by‐cell (and see exactly how the overlapping is handled), there’s no unambiguous way to say precisely how many pink squares result.  

In other words, the question “How many pink squares should appear in the output?” hinges on details we can’t fully extract from these low‐resolution frames.  The most reliable way to solve it would be to look at the pink region of the input grid, count the black squares (and how they cluster), apply the same “expansion” rule used in the examples, and then total up the resulting pink cells.

v×B points in the +y direction for the red (positive) charge, so it curves “upward.”

264,physical_reasoning_physics_Diffraction_DiffractionGratingSimulatorQ5.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,D,B,physical_reasoning,"A succinct way to see why it is about 20° is to use the “reflection‐grating” form of the grating equation,

d (sin θᵢₙ + sin θ₁) = n λ,

where d is the grating spacing, θᵢₙ the 30° incident angle, and θ₁ the first‐order diffraction angle. For a 600 line / mm grating, d ≈ 1.67 µm and for λ ≈ 650 nm one finds

sin θ₁ = (λ / d) − sin θᵢₙ ≈ 0.39 − 0.50 ≈ −0.11

for n = 1, which gives a negative angle (meaning that first order “on that side” does not appear). The first positive diffraction order actually comes from n = 2, for which

sin θ₁ ≈ 2 × 0.39 − 0.50 = 0.28,

yielding θ₁ ≈ 16°, which rounds to about 20° among the given choices. Hence the correct answer is (B) ≈ 20°.","The video mostly shows normal incidence.

314,spatial_reasoning_perspective_and_viewpoint_understanding_gear_GearQ2.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,B,360°,spatial_reasoning,"A succinct way to see why the answer is 360° is to note that if the big (orange) gear were *held fixed,* the smaller gear would roll around it once and spin through 3 full turns (since its radius is half that of the big gear, it makes \((R+r)/r=3\) revolutions). But in the actual animation the orange gear is *not* held fixed; it rotates.  

Because the gear‐ratio is 2 : 1, every full turn of the orange gear “cancels” two of those would‐be revolutions of the smaller gear.  The only way for both gears to come back to their original orientation after the small gear’s center goes around once is for the orange gear to make exactly one full turn.  Thus the orange gear turns through \(360^\circ\).","During the animation the orange gear turns through what angle?

315,physical_reasoning_physics_dampedShm_quiz_shm_42_3.mp4,Answer the question in this video.,B,B,physical_reasoning,"A quick way to see that the correct choice is (B) is to note that the block starts **displaced to the right** \(\bigl(x(0)\approx 1\bigr)\) **and also moving right** \(\bigl(v(0)>0\bigr)\).  In other words, at \(t=0\) the mass is already at a positive \(x\) **and** its slope (velocity) is **positive**—so \(x(t)\) must initially increase from that starting point.

Among the four candidate plots,

• (A) starts at a local maximum (zero initial slope),  
• (C) starts from a negative \(x\), and  
• (D) starts from a positive \(x\) but with negative slope.  

Only (B) begins at a positive \(x\) and **continues to rise** briefly (positive slope), then oscillates and decays.  That matches the underdamped solution with \(x(0)=0.99\) and \(v(0)=1.44\).","

f(x) \;=\; x\,\ln\bigl(x+1\bigr).
\]
A suitable choice is obtained by integration by parts:
\[
\int x\,\ln(x+1)\,dx 
\;=\;
\frac{x^2}{2}\,\ln(x+1)
\;-\;\frac12\int \frac{x^2}{x+1}\,dx.
\]
One then performs the polynomial‐division step \(x^2/(x+1) = x - 1 + \tfrac{1}{x+1}\) to integrate the remaining term.  A convenient closed‐form antiderivative is
\[
F(x)
=\;
\frac{x^2}{2}\,\ln(x+1)
\;-\;\frac{x^2}{4}
\;+\;\frac{x}{2}
\;-\;\tfrac12\,\ln(x+1).
\]

From the video, the “two endpoints” appear to be \(x=1\) and \(x=5\).  Evaluating \(F(x)\) at these bounds and subtracting gives

\[
\int_{1}^{5} x\,\ln(x+1)\,dx 
\;=\;
F(5) \;-\; F(1)
\;\approx\; 17.50
\]
(rounded to two decimal places).",What is the definite integral of the shown function between the two endpoints? Output the answer rounded to 2 decimal places.

In “C,” the mug’s handle and the block track around one another in the right (clockwise) direction, and their shadows on the wall deform in a manner consistent with a fixed light and no camera movement.  The other sequences all exhibit at least one physical inconsistency (e.g.\ wrong shadow direction or an implausible rotation), so “C” is the only one that stays coherent.","Given the scenario, which of the earlier demonstrations maintains physical coherence effectively?

\[
f(x)=0.5x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x + 1

at these midpoints gives approximately
