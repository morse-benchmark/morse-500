The task is to identify which number is on the top face of the cube. Since the cube is black and the numbers are not visible until we rotate the cube, we need to see the numbers on each face and figure out which one is on the top.

After analyzing the given information, we have different assumptions about the numbers on the top face of the cube:

- Assumption One proposes that the number on the top face is 1.
- Assumption Two proposes that the number on the top face is 5.
- Assumption Three proposes that the number on the top face is 3.
- Assumption Four proposes that the number on the top face is something else, but the video doesn't provide more information.

To make this an open-ended question, we can discuss the different assumptions and see which one is the most likely based on the information provided.
